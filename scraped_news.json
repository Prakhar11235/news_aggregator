        "author": "Kate Whannel",
        "published_date": "6 hours ago",
        "summary": "The US president says a trade deal could happen very quickly and avoid taxes on UK imports.",
        "content": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer. Speaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. The trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. Sir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK. Receiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\". Sir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. Having confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes. The US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. On the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. However, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine. Asked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". He said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. The US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. He later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday. The UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. However, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". The deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. After taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". Referring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. He said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. He also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK. Asked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\" \"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said. \"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\" In a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". Since leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US. In his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way. However, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "headline": "Trump says US will impose additional 10% tariff on China",
        "author": "Natalie Sherman",
        "published_date": "7 hours ago",
        "summary": "He also said he would move ahead with 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, which had been paused.",
        "content": "Donald Trump said he planned to hit goods from China with a new 10% tariff, the latest salvo in the US president's steadily escalating trade fights. Imports from China already face taxes at the border of at least 10%, after a Trump tariff order that went into effect earlier this month. Trump also said on Thursday he intended to move forward with threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which are set to come into effect on 4 March. His comments came as officials from Mexico and Canada were in Washington for discussions aimed at heading off that plan. Trump had announced the plans for 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 4 February unless the two nations increased border security. He paused the measures for a month at the last minute after the two countries agreed to increase border funding and talk more about how to combat drug trafficking. On social media on Thursday, Trump wrote that he did not think enough action had been taken to address the flow of fentanyl to the US. \"Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,\" he wrote, adding that \"a large percentage\" of the drugs were made in China. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, at a press conference from the country's National Palace, said in response: \"As we know, [Trump] has his way of communicating.\" She added: \"I hope we can reach an agreement and on 4 March we can announce something else.\" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said his country was working hard to reach a deal, warning tariffs from the US would prompt an \"immediate and extremely strong response\". Trump's threats against Mexico and Canada have raised widespread alarm, as the North American economy is closely connected after decades of operating under a free trade agreement. Leaders of the two countries have previously said they would impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if the White House went ahead with its plans. Tariffs are a tax collected by the government and paid for by the business bringing the goods into the country. China, Mexico and Canada are America's top three trade partners, together accounting for more than 40% of imports into the US last year. Economists have warned tariffs on goods from the three countries could lead to higher prices in the US on everything from iPhones to avocados. Trump's call for an additional 10% levy on goods from China - which he said would also go into effect on Tuesday - had not been previously announced, though during his presidential campaign he backed border taxes on Chinese products of as much as 60%. Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, said his country was already working with the US to address the concerns about fentanyl, and had made \"visual progress\" in areas such as information exchange, case cooperation and online advertisement cleanup. \"Reducing domestic drug demand and strengthening law enforcement cooperation are the fundamental solutions,\" he said in a statement, which warned that Trump's tariff moves were \"bound to affect and undermine future counternarcotics cooperation between the two sides\". \"The unilateral tariffs imposed by the US will not solve its own problems, nor will it benefit the two sides or the world.\"  Trump's comments, which called for drug flow to stop or be \"severely limited\", seemed to set the stage for Mexico and Canada to negotiate, said trade expert Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Washington University. On Thursday, as tariff talks intensified, two imprisoned alleged leaders of the violent Zetas cartel long sought by the US - Miguel Angel Trevino Morales and his brother Oscar - were extradited. Mexican media said they were part of a larger group of drug lords sent from Mexico to the US - a major step in terms of US-Mexico security relations. Ms McDaniel said Trump's demands of China were less clear, raising the likelihood that those measures will come into effect. Trump's initial round of tariffs on China was eclipsed by his threats against Canada and Mexico. But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond. Ms McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China. \"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said. The impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market. But analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US. China has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery. Trump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy. The leader of the Canadian province campaigned on the need to fight US President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing. The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.

        "content": "Goldman Sachs has pledged £1.5m to a West Midlands apprenticeship fund to help businesses in the region to develop their staff. The investment bank announced it would be committing funds from its apprenticeship levy to the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA) levy transfer scheme. The money will help small and medium-sized businesses, charities and social enterprises to invest in and develop staff. West Midlands Mayor Richard Parker said the WMCA's apprenticeship levy scheme had already raised £50m, funding 4,800 apprentices in the region. Parker added more residents could get access to apprenticeships and smaller businesses could train workforces for the future following the boost in funding. \"Only by working together can we tackle one of the biggest problems faced by our region, unemployment, particularly among young people,\" he said. \"Goldman Sachs has already shown their dedication to the region with their offices in Birmingham, but now they are showing how they are supporting our residents too.\" The investment firm established its Birmingham office in 2021 and now has more than 450 employees in the city, moving to a permanent office at One Centenary Way last year. Gurjit Jagpal, head of Goldman Sachs Birmingham, said they were proud to support the expansion of apprenticeships in the region. \"This reflects our ongoing commitment to Birmingham and our belief in the importance of digital and workplace skills,\" he said. \"The depth and quality of talent in the region has been a differentiator since we opened our Birmingham office,\" he said, \"and we look forward to continuing to engage positively with local communities to invest in talent across all levels of experience.\" This news was gathered by the Local Democracy Reporting Service which covers councils and other public service organisations.

        "summary": "Kwek Leng Beng, the chairman of property giant CDL, has accused his son of plotting a boardroom coup.",
        "content": "A Succession-like feud has engulfed one of Singapore's richest families as property tycoon Kwek Leng Beng accused his son of plotting a boardroom takeover. Mr Kwek says he has filed court papers accusing his son Sherman of trying to take control of their real estate firm City Developments Limited (CDL). Sherman Kwek has denied the allegation. Kwek Leng Beng, who is CDL's executive chairman, is also seeking to fire his son, who is the chief executive. CDL, Singapore's biggest listed property developer, has halted trading in its shares on the financial hub's stock exchange. The feud has sparked comparisons with the HBO television series Succession, in which the fictional Roy family fight for control of the global media firm Waystar RoyCo. \"We intend to change the chief executive officer at the appropriate time,\" Kwek Leng Beng said in a statement. \"As a father, firing my son was certainly not an easy decision.\" But the octogenarian added: \"This is necessary to deal with this attempted coup at the board level and restore corporate integrity.\" If Sherman Kwek is removed as chief executive, his father said he plans to replace him on an interim basis with his cousin Kwek Eik Sheng. The dispute centres on an email sent by CDL's corporate secretary nominating two additional independent directors on the night of 28 January, the eve of the Lunar New Year - which marks the start of a major holiday in Singapore. The row has attracted public attention in a part of the world in which battles over family businesses are not uncommon and have been known to end up in court. After Wednesday's court hearing, Kwek Leng Beng said the two new directors had agreed to not exercise any powers until further notice. The company has said Sherman Kwek would remain in the role until the issue was resolved. Sherman Kwek said he and the majority of CDL's board were disappointed by what he described as extreme actions taken by his father \"regarding this disagreement around the size and make-up of the CDL board.\" “To reiterate, this has never been about ousting our esteemed chairman. These steps to strengthen our board have purely been to ensure CDL has the highest standards of governance to which it has become known,\" he said in a statement to the BBC. Kwek Leng Beng, along with his father and brother, took control of then-loss-making CDL in 1971. He became the firm's executive chairman after his father's death in 1995. It now has more than 160 hotel, residential and commercial properties around the world and forms part of a multi-billion dollar family empire.

        "headline": "Amazon joins quantum race with 'cat qubit' powered chip",
        "author": "Chris Vallance",
        "published_date": "16 hours ago",
        "summary": "The prototype chip it dubs Ocelot follows similar announcements by Microsoft and Google",
        "content": "Amazon has become the third tech giant in as many months to announce a breakthrough in quantum computing - a technology that promises vast processing power but is beset by technical difficulties. The firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on \"cat qubit\" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous \"Schrödinger's cat\" thought experiment. The chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free. Amazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought. But how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts. Oskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an \"aggressive date\" of a decade was now \"looking more and more realistic\". \"Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years\", he said but added \"this timeline's come in quite a bit.\" Ultimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business. \"You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,\" he explained. Quantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics. Quantum computers won't replace so-called \"classical\" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines. But that potential is being held up by the problem of errors. Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected. Cat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses. Qubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today. Cat qubits are named in honour of Erwin Schrödinger, whose cat-in-a-box question in 1935 helped illuminate some of the thinking behind quantum theory. Amazon believes the new chip, which has just five cat qubits out of a total of 14 key components, could reduce the costs of correcting quantum errors by up to 90%, compared to current approaches. The technology of cat qubits isn't exclusive to Amazon, a French company named Alice & Bob carried out pioneering work on the tech and continues to evolve the technology. Mazyar Mirrahimi director of research at the French national technology research institute, Inria said Ocelot was \"an important step forward towards hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation\". Amazon believes the new chip offers a path to scaling up to more powerful machines with this type of error proofing built in, but researchers admit there are many challenges ahead. Michael Cuthbert director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre welcomed the progress Amazon had made but told the BBC it remained to be seen the effect it would have on the speed with which the industry is able to develop really useful quantum computers: \"Error correction is a vital step necessary in the long-term development of quantum computing. It is the crucial step that turns quantum computing into a practical and commercial tool we can use to solve complex problems in chemistry, materials science, medicine, logistics and energy.\" \"Part of the challenge is how to scale the revolutionary technology efficiently – mechanisms that enable error correction without huge overheads in chip size, energy consumption and systems complexity are really welcome.\" Amazon researchers have published their findings in a research paper in the scientific journal Nature Amazon joins Microsoft and Google in announcing a new experimental chip. But is this flurry of announcements the result of clever research or clever PR? Or is it  coincidence, the tech equivalent of the saying buses always come in threes? Heather West follows the quantum computing industry as a research manager for the International Data Corporation and was briefed on the new chip by Amazon in advance of publication. She describes Amazon's results as an \"advancement\" rather than a breakthrough. All three recent announcements have focused on reducing errors, and she tells me the industry is \"pivoting\" from a focus on the number of qubits to a focus the \"ability to use these these systems at scale to solve real world life problems. And by doing so we need to be able to solve the error correction within the quantum systems\". However Mr Painter agreed \"100%\" that it wouldn't be easy to scale up today's experimental systems.

        "headline": "Trump says 25% tariffs on EU will be announced soon",
        "author": "Michelle Fleury & Natalie Sherman",
        "published_date": "22 hours ago",
        "summary": "\"The EU was formed to screw the United States,\" Trump says.\n",
        "content": "US President Donald Trump has said he is planning to hit goods made in the European Union with tariffs of 25%, claiming the bloc was created to \"screw the United States\". \"We'll be announcing it very soon,\" he told reporters at an appearance with members of his cabinet. \"It'll be 25% generally speaking and that will be on cars and all other things.\" The European Union said it would react \"firmly and immediately against unjustified tariffs\". Trump's appearance sparked questions about his trade plans, as he also appeared to raise the possibility that looming tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, set to come into force on 4 March, might be postponed again. An administration official later said the deadline remained in place, with the president planning to review Mexico and Canada actions related to border security over the coming days. Trump made clear on Wednesday that trade with Europe also remained in his sights, repeating his criticism of European policies, which he said put American exporters of food products and cars at a disadvantage. \"The European Union was formed to screw the United States - that's the purpose of it and they've done a good job of it,\" he said.  \"But now I'm president.\" The EU rejected the president's claims, saying the creation of a regional market had made doing business in Europe easier for American firms. \"It has been a boon for the United States,\" a spokesperson for the commission said. \"We're ready to partner if you play by the rules. But we will also protect our consumers and businesses at every turn. They expect no less from us.\" Tariffs are a tax on imports that is collected by the government and paid for by the companies bringing in the goods. Trump has vowed to use the levies to boost US manufacturing, raise money and push other countries to change policies he opposes. But there are concerns such measures could fuel inflation, with warnings that Americans could face higher prices for goods as businesses may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers. Since taking office, he has raised tariffs of 10% on goods from China and taken steps to hit other imports with duties, including directing his staff to develop recommendations for custom \"reciprocal\" tariffs for each country. But he has also suspended some of those plans, leaving many businesses and analysts guessing as to whether he is prepared to carry out his threats. \"The 25% threat that he threw out today is in line with the high end of the range that he previously indicated,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of US policy and politics at Wolfe Research. \"It's a number that's concerning - certainly should be concerning - for the trans-Atlantic trade relationship, but not totally out of the blue.\" Antonin Finkelnburg, of the Federation of German Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services which represents businesses, told the BBC that a 25% tariff on EU goods entering the US would created a \"difficult\" but \"not an impossible\" situation for Germany's economy. \"We are worried but we shouldn't be afraid,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. Germany's car industry's products are popular in the US. Mr Finkelnburg said many German car manufacturers were \"already producing in the American market, so they wouldn't be directly affected by the tariffs\", but said tariffs would still drive up prices. \"The car parts that are manufactured in to those cars are crossing the borders of Mexico and Canada several times so that already is driving the prices up,\" he added. Earlier this month, Trump ordered 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, America's top two trading partners. But he suspended the duties before they went into effect until 4 March, to allow for talks on border security. On Monday, Trump said he expected tariffs of 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada to come into effect \"on schedule\". At Wednesday's meeting, when asked for an update, he said the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada would go into effect on 2 April. That is the same day that the Commerce Department is supposed to deliver its wider recommendations for \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters that \"the overall is April 2\" , distinguishing between tariffs tied to concerns about drug trafficking and migration from Mexico and Canada. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all headed lower in mid-day trade, while the peso and Canadian dollar gained. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing. \"What a beautiful accent,\" the US president said of the British leader. Sarah Smith breaks down their White House meeting. Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan have left Romania, where they were previously under a travel ban. He also said he would move ahead with 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, which had been paused.

        "content": "Instagram is reportedly considering launching its short-form video feature, Reels, as a separate app as the future of Chinese-owned TikTok remains uncertain in the US. The social media platform's boss Adam Mosseri told staff about the potential move this week, according to technology industry–focused business publication The Information, which cited a person who heard the remarks. Instagram's parent company Meta did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. In January, US President Donald Trump granted TikTok a 75-day extension to comply with a law signed by then-President Joe Biden that requires a sale or ban of the platform. At the time, he floated the possibility of a joint venture running the company, saying he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between \"the United States\" and its Chinese owner ByteDance. But he did not give any further details on how that might work. The Biden administration had argued that TikTok, which has 170 million US users, could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation. Opponents of a ban have cited freedom of speech as a reason for keeping the platform open. In 2018, Meta launched a standalone app called Lasso to compete with TikTok but it was later shut down.

        "published_date": "2 days ago",
        "summary": "The oil and gas producer faces criticism for its shift away from green energy, but many support it.",
        "content": "It was more than 20 years ago that the then boss of BP reframed those famous initials as \"Beyond Petroleum\". It was the first tentative step in transforming the company from an oil and gas producer to an energy provider investing an increasing amount of its fossil fuel profits into greener technology. Five years ago, chief executive Bernard Looney, who was in charge at the time, accelerated that process with ambitious targets to cut oil and gas production 40% by 2030, while massively ramping up investment in wind and solar. Today, BP could stand for \"Back to Petroleum\" following its announcement to shift back to oil and gas production and slash investment in renewables. Why? Profit and share price. There is simply less money in renewables than in oil and gas and some BP shareholders have become angry and impatient as they watch Shell produce double the returns they have seen while Exxon investors have received four times as much. For most - but not all - shareholders, the number one job of a company's board and management is to maximise the value of the company. BP's failure to do this has led to active speculation that BP should be taken over by a company that understands this. Or one that list its shares in the US where investors are less interested in a green transition. Not all shareholders agree with BP's radical strategy shift back to petroleum. Dozens of them signed a letter expressing concern about increasing fossil fuel production and want to have a say in the company's direction of travel. BP's move follows rivals' Shell and Norwegian company Equinor scaling back of plans to invest in green energy. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels. Many groups say that long term BP and others are pursuing a no-win strategy. Climate concerns will become so acute that much of the oil and gas they're searching for will have to remain in the ground and become unusable \"stranded assets\" of no commercial value. However, the least patient shareholders tend to have the loudest voices. As such, the cries of dismay from those concerned about the climate are being drowned out by those demanding that BP does what it knows best: drilling for oil and gas and returning those profits to shareholders, who include millions of pension savers. They would say it is not BP's job to question how much oil and gas the world wants or needs - that is the job for the societies it serves and their policy makers. And, while the UK government has decided it wants no new oil and exploration in UK waters, over 90% of BP's activities are outside the UK and the current US government thinks very differently. Gas and electricity bills will rise again on 1 April, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. The oil giant faces allegations it ignored warnings that a clean-up scheme was beset by corruption. The oil giant is widely expected to say it will scale back on renewables later this month.

        "content": "Nell Diamond, CEO of Hill House, shares how her small business skyrocketed to global success with a simple, singular product. At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hill House Home's Nap Dress became more than just a piece of clothing – it was a symbol of comfort and versatility for a world in flux. What started as a direct-to-consumer bedding and home business in 2016 had grown into a fashion movement, reflecting how a single dress could adapt to your body over the years and transform depending on the demands of the day. The company introduced the Nap Dress in 2019, a design that leaned into the idea of smocked fabric from the 1950s and reimagined it with modern, universal appeal. It didn't take long for the dress – now with over 50 designs – to go viral on social media and become common in many closets around the world. \"Our crazy growth happened from 2019 to 2020 – right in the middle of quarantine and while I was pregnant with twins,\" CEO Nell Diamond tells the BBC. \"I could obviously see how much the business was changing internally from the sales volume, but one really pivotal moment for me was working from home, sitting in my bedroom in New York City, and looking out the window to see someone walking down the street wearing one of our dresses. EXECUTIVE LOUNGE The BBC's series features interviews with executive leaders making innovative, data-driven decisions helping shape the future of business – and paving the path for other leaders to thrive. Read more conversations here. \"Entrepreneurship can feel really lonely and insular, so to realise that people know about your little project is incredibly rewarding. I'll never forget that moment.\" Since then, the company has sold over one million Nap Dresses, expanded into categories like outerwear and swimwear, and opened five retail locations across the United States, from New York to Charleston. The brand's reach has also expanded within other retailers, including Shopbop and Saks. Hill House puts its current valuation at approximately $150m (£118m), although the BBC was unable to obtain an independent valuation. The company has faced challenges, too, including navigating global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and scaling operations to meet increased demand. But at a time when small businesses struggle to stand out amid economic uncertainty, Hill House's story underscores the importance of adaptability and building strong connections with consumers. \"We've had the biggest year in company history,\" Diamond said. \"The business has continued to grow past even our optimistic plans.\" Diamond's love of fashion started early, during her teenage years while attending the American School in London, UK. After graduating from Princeton University, she joined the trading desk of a finance firm, initially entering the same sector of business as her father Bob Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays bank. She quickly realised, however, that her passion lay elsewhere. \"I was always drawn to retail,\" she says. \"I'd steal my friends' equity research papers to learn what companies were doing in the retail space. I realised that this thing which started as a guilty pleasure – loving fashion – turned out to be a viable career opportunity.\" Now, as CEO, Diamond oversees every aspect of the business, from growth strategy to creative direction. Below, she talks with the BBC about the company's biggest challenges, its rapid evolution into a lifestyle brand and plans for the future. Hill House dates back to a startup incubator you joined while in business school at Yale University. How did you turn the idea into a fully fledged business? I wanted to bring a design-forward point of view to the home category. We started with just home products: bedding, pillows, a little bit of pyjamas and robes. But I really focused on the home and, in particular, the bedroom, drawing off of some of the design elements of my London upbringing – great British brands like [interior decorating firm] Colfax and Fowler and amazing prints that I had seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum. There were many businesses launching direct-to-consumer [approaches] and talking about cutting out the middleman. I wanted to do the same thing and … start small and focus on just one or two products. While I was at business school, I spent time on the little parts of starting a business – trademarks, legal documents, hiring my first few contractors and setting up our Instagram account. After graduating, I spent the first couple of years bootstrapping the business and really focusing on meeting our customers. It was a very small team in a co-working space in New York City. By 2019, everything dramatically changed overnight. We went from low and slow and careful growth to the success of the Nap Dress. Within a few months, our business was majority a fashion business based off the strength of this one product line. We went from five people to 30 people and from one store to now having almost six stores. It really changed the scale of the business. I remember our very first order was for a hundred units and being petrified that we wouldn't actually sell them. To have sold a million of them now is really crazy. Why do you think this one particular product, the Nap Dress, resonates with so many people? It's so many different things. We didn't invent smocking, which is what makes our dresses most identifiable. My grandmother was wearing smock dresses in the 1950s. Juicy Couture [the Los Angeles-based clothing brand] popularised smocking and terry cloth in the 2000s. But I think what was so important to us was figuring out a very proprietary type of smocking that could stretch with you. I wore it all throughout my twin pregnancy and then the snap back. It works with your changing body and throughout the day – it feels comfortable but you still look kind of put together. When we first launched the Nap Dress, we would have somebody email in and say: \"Oh, my friend was wearing this dress at a dinner party, or at work or at preschool pickup, and I have to have it.\" It was exacerbated by social media, but organic social media, which is the important distinction there. Even today, 30% of orders on our site come from word-of-mouth referrals. What are some challenges you faced in the early days that you had to overcome? There were – and continues to be – challenges every day. Early on and certainly during Covid, there were constant disruptions in the global supply chain, whether it was that one factory had to shut down or another one had delayed shipping. In 2021, we expected we'd be able to have all the products here by a certain date for a product drop. There were crazy delays at ports all over due to shipping freight issues. That can affect your entire summer selling, your entire quarter of selling. In this increasingly online, seamless-delivery Amazon-dominated world, it is easy to forget how many human touch points there are and how fragile they can be. We internally would get so anxious and nervous any time one of those human touch points had a blockage. But when we told our customers what was happening, people loved having that insight into the humanity behind the products they're actually buying. I think it made it feel more personal to them. And that might be one of the many reasons why we have such a loyal customer base – we let them into that side of the business. It's clear that it's not so robotic and transactional. How do you check that manufacturing partners and suppliers are abiding by the highest standards? We have manufacturers in 12 countries across nearly all continents. It's all about tracking at every stage of the development process. We take that very seriously. We work with an organisation called Transparency One that helps us track across our supply chain at every stage and audit what our manufacturers are reporting. We've had many of the same manufacturers since day one and developed those human relationships with the people who make our clothes. One of our main manufacturers is the same person who we sent those first hundred unit orders to, and they should feel a tremendous amount of ownership over the growth that we've seen over the past couple years. You've publicly said before that the business is very reliant on global trading routes and global supply chains. Now given that President-elect Trump has campaigned on raising tariffs for imports, are you concerned about how this might affect costs and global trade more generally? I can only speak for our own company, but I think that tariffs are certainly something we are thinking about. By the numbers 1 million nap dresses sold 50 styles of the Nap Dress 5 retail stores: Nantucket, New York, Palm Beach, Charleston, Dallas 80 employees ~$150m valuation How have you been expanding the brand? We have a concept called Nells at our store in Charleston, South Carolina, inspired by my British upbringing. It's a pick-and-mix candy station, and there's a coffee and fountain soda bar, a nod to the Americana roots of the brand as well. It's never been easier to shop online, so if you're asking customers to come into your store, you should be delivering an experience that makes it worth it. The home category is still really big for us now. But it just seems small in comparison to how all the fashion is doing. A new category we recently launched is swim – and that's performing really well. We asked what else our customers wanted to see from Hill House, and swim was an early answer. The fashion world can be notoriously fickle. How can you ensure your products remain relevant across changes in fashion on the street? We focus on our core customer, so I'm not so worried about what's relevant for anyone except for them. It can be easy in fashion to get caught up in a trend cycle, but our core customer is really focused on cute clothes that make them feel great and carry them through all of their different things that they have to do that day. Within that formula, we can deliver a product that makes them happy and not be so focused on a constant cycle of newness. It's about building pieces that last in their wardrobe. What advice do you have for smaller businesses hoping to expand and build? One of the most important pieces of advice I got when I was first starting out was to keep your blinders on. I remember constantly playing the comparison game in the early days and looking at other brands, Instagrams or advertisements or stores, thinking: \"We should have done that and we should have done this, and why can't we do that?\" That was never productive for me. I had a real unlock when I started to tune out some of that noise and focus on what we have going on internally and how to make that as good as it possibly could be and can be. I mute a lot of people on Instagram if I'm getting a negative feeling from it. I always talk about putting the mute button on in real life, too, if something's not serving you in that way.

Do you think the Nap Dress will always be the centerpiece of the business? My perception is that the Nap Dress will always be a hero product for us. But the growth right now is coming out of these new products, categories and from the retail channel. It's really exciting because I think that our customers have given us permission to go into not only these other rooms of their home but other activities they're doing with swim and outerwear. I'm also incredibly bullish on retail. I would love to open more stores. We're very much a one-year-at-a-time brand, so I'd like to start with a couple more. But because we are very customer led, I'll let them tell us [what's next]. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "author": "Brandon Drenon",
        "published_date": "14 hours ago",
        "summary": "A US bird flu epidemic has resulted in the deaths of tens-of-millions of poultry and strained the country's egg supply.",
        "content": "The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced a $1bn (£792m) plan to help US farmers combat a raging bird flu epidemic that has required them to kill millions of chickens and pushed the cost of eggs to an all-time high. Officials said they will budget $500m for biosecurity measures, roughly $100m for vaccine research and development, and $400m for farmer financial relief programs. More than 35 million birds have been killed in response to bird flu outbreaks in commercial flocks this year, according to USDA data. The bird culling has caused the average price for a dozen eggs in the US to hit $5 in January, a 53% increase from 2024 - and the USDA said prices could rise an additional 41%. The Trump administration said it will provide commercial egg farms with best practices and consulting services for free, and pay up to 75% of the costs to address vulnerabilities to help prevent the spread of bird flu. To address the threat of an egg shortage for US consumers, the government said it was willing to  consider temporarily importing eggs that meet US safety standards. The USDA also said it will eliminate regulations that they say raise the cost of eggs. The policy changes are not expected to have an immediate affect on egg prices, USDA secretary Brooke Rollins told the BBC's media partner CBS News. \"This is more of a long-term solution, but what I can say is that those prices should start coming down maybe this spring, this summer as we work to implement some of those bigger-picture solutions,\" Rollins said. Soaring egg prices in the US have had some surprising knock on effects. In New York City, where a dozen eggs can fetch $14, some stores have reportedly started successfully selling single eggs - called \"loosies\" - to those unwilling to shell out for a full dozen. In February, thieves in Pennsylvania stole over 100,000 eggs worth $40,000 from the back of a lorry. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "author": "Natalie Sherman",
        "published_date": "1 day ago",
        "summary": "Boss Jensen Huang responds to concerns about an AI bubble sparked by Chinese firm DeepSeek. ",
        "content": "Nvidia, the chip giant at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, said its business remained strong, despite fears of a bubble stirred by the emergence of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek last month. Sales of the firm's chips hit more than $39bn (£30.7bn) over the three months ended 27 January, up 74% year-on-year. Nvidia has seen a surge of demand, as big tech companies turn to the firm for chips that can handle the large amounts of data used to train AI models. But DeepSeek said it had trained its chatbot using less advanced, and less expensive chips. Its launch prompted a sharp sell-off in Nvidia shares earlier this month, a hit felt throughout the market. Investors calmed after big companies such as Facebook owner Meta said they expected to continue their current AI investment strategies. Nvidia boss Jensen Huang said he was not worried that demand would suddenly shift, saying that software in the future would be created by machine learning that needs chips with different architecture than the \"hand-coding\" of the past. \"We know fundamentally software has changed,\" he said, adding that it was also still \"early days\" for the use of AI to spread. Nvidia currently dominates the market in advanced chips, making it central to the boom in AI investment at companies such as Microsoft. Its shares have surged more than 400% over the last two years, giving the company a market value of more than $3tn. Nvidia said it was focused on rapidly building out production of its latest chips, known as Blackwell, which helped to drive a surge in the firm's revenue. The company's finance chief Collette Kress said its AI data centre business was strongest in the US, but the firm was also seeing demand grow in other parts of the world, pointing to investments by France and the European Union. She said demand in China - where US trade controls have blocked the firm from exporting certain chips - remained lower and that the firm expected shipments to remain roughly at the current level. A clip of Donald Trump Jr allegedly saying on his podcast that the US should have sent arms to Russia rather than Ukraine was very likely generated with AI, experts say. It is available from March and included in a Prime subscription - or $19.99 to non-members. Experts have questioned the company's explanation that it is due to the two words being similar.

        "summary": "The move marks a major shift and prompted the outlet's opinion editor David Shipley to resign.",
        "content": "Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos has announced that the newspaper's opinion section will focus on supporting “personal liberties and free markets\", and pieces opposing those views will not be published. The move, which marks a major shift away from the section's broad opinion coverage, prompted the outlet's opinion editor David Shipley to resign. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, sent a memo to staff on Wednesday which he also posted to X. “We are going to be writing every day in support and defence of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,“ Bezos said. He added the opinion section would cover other topics, but “viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others”. “There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader's doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views,” Bezos wrote. “Today, the internet does that job.” Bezos added that he had asked Mr Shipley if he wanted to stay at the outlet after the changes, but he said no. \"This is a significant shift, it won't be easy, and it will require 100% commitment - I respect his decision,\" Bezos said. The billionaire businessman's move is a significant intervention in the editorial side of the newspaper, which he acquired in 2013. It follows a decision last year not to run an endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, and to stop making presidential endorsements in general, which led to resignations and the loss of thousands of subscribers. According to the Washington Post, Will Lewis, the outlet’s chief executive, said in a memo to staff that the changes to the opinion section were \"not about siding with any political party”. \"This is about being crystal clear about what we stand for as a newspaper,\" he said. The decision was praised by several of President Donald Trump‘s allies, including billionaire Elon Musk, who wrote on social media: “Bravo, @JeffBezos!\" But on a Washington Post article announcing the change, some subscribers wrote in the comment section criticising the decision, and others said they would be cancelling their subscription.

        "published_date": "1 day ago",
        "summary": "Trump say wealthy investors will buy the visas and create jobs in the US, while helping pay off US debt. ",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has unveiled plans for selling a \"gold card\" visa for $5m (£3.9m) that will offer wealthy buyers permanent residency in the US and a path to citizenship. At the first cabinet meeting of his current term, Trump told reporters that the visas would function similarly to green cards, which allow immigrants of varying incomes to live and work permanently in the US, but would go to  \"high-level people\". \"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, also at the meeting, said the gold visas would replace the current visa programme for foreign investors, but offered few details. Dozens of countries around the world offer some sort of citizenship by investment programme, including several in Europe, like Portugal, which gives \"golden visas\", or permanent residency for foreigners who invest €500,000 ($524,000) into a qualifying fund. Trump said companies would use the golden visa programme to hire non-citizens to work for them in the US. \"We have to be able to get people in the country, and we want people that are productive people,\" Trump said. Typically, green card holders in the US can apply for citizenship after five years. Trump suggested revenue from the high-priced visas could be used to pay off US debt. Lutnick said that the initiative will replace the EB-5 visa, which gives permanent residency to some foreigners who invest around $1m and create at least 10 full-time jobs in the US. Saying the EB-5 programme was \"poorly overseen and poorly executed\",  Lutnick said the golden visas would be an improvement. \"We're going to make sure they're wonderful world-class global citizens,\" Lutnick said of future gold card applicants. It was not immediately clear how the government would select recipients, if there were exclusions, or if there would be any cap on how many are issued. During the fiscal year of 2024, the State Department issued over 12,000 EB-5 visas, a record high for the programme.

        "author": "Mike Wendling",
        "published_date": "1 day ago",
        "summary": "Justices appeared sympathetic to a woman who claims she was denied jobs because she is heterosexual. ",
        "content": "US Supreme Court justices indicated during a hearing on Wednesday that they would side with a woman who alleged she was discriminated against at her job because she is heterosexual. Marlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department of Youth Services for more than 20 years. She claims she was passed over for a promotion, then demoted, because she is straight. The job she hoped to get and the one she held when demoted, were both given to gay colleagues, according to the lawsuit. Ohio state officials have denied the discrimination, and Ms Ames has so far been unsuccessful in court. In oral arguments in front of the Supreme Court - split 6-3 in favour of conservative judges - justices on both sides ideologically appeared sympathetic to Ms Ames's case. A 1964 US law forbids discrimination in the workplace, and in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that protection extends to sexual orientation, however lower courts have dismissed Ms Ames's case. US court precedent covering some states, including Ohio, requires that members of majority groups - such as white people or heterosexuals - show a higher level of evidence when making discrimination claims. Plaintiffs in those cases – sometimes called \"reverse discrimination\" – are required to show additional \"background circumstances\" to prove their case, for instance evidence that LGBTQ people made decisions affecting the person discriminated against, or evidence showing a pattern of discrimination. According to the lawsuit, Ms Ames had positive performance evaluations, but in 2019 she and two other heterosexual employees were passed over for a promotion that was eventually given to a lesbian. She was later demoted, according to the lawsuit, and her job was given to a gay man. In addition to ruling that Ms Ames did not show a pattern of discrimination or \"background circumstances\", a lower court also previously found that managers at the youth services department had \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons\" for their decisions. During arguments on Wednesday, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of the court's conservative members, said: \"Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, whether you are gay or straight, is prohibited. The rules are the same whichever way it goes.\" According to the transcript of the hearing, another conservative justice, Amy Coney Barrett, said that \"it doesn't matter if she was gay or whether she was straight\", the legal burden should be the same. And several of the court's liberal justices seemed to agree. Neil Gorsuch indicated that he thought allowing Ms Ames' lawsuit to proceed would be a \"wise course\". While talking about the facts of the case, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said \"something's suspicious\" which \"certainly can give rise to an inference of discrimination.\" Ohio officials were represented in court by the state Solicitor General T Elliot Gaiser, a former lawyer for Trump. Gaiser told the justices \"everyone here agrees that everyone should be treated equally\", but argued that the officials who made the job decisions did not know Ames' sexual orientation and thus could not have used it to discriminate against her. Lawyers for the state also argue that those making the employment decisions were heterosexual and had legitimate concerns about Ms Ames's vision for the youth services department. The Supreme Court could order lower courts to re-examine the case and allow the lawsuit to go ahead. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.

        "summary": "CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara speaks to the BBC about the future of the world's most valuable media franchise.",
        "content": "The boss of The Pokémon Company believes the series can last for at least another 50 years if it continues to innovate. First launched on Nintendo's Game Boy in 1996, the video game has expanded into films, TV and toys to become one of the world's highest-grossing media franchise. Most recently, the trading card game based on the cute creatures at the centre of its universe has seen a surge in popularity - but it has also brought scalpers and frauds to the hobby. CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara, who has been in charge of the company since 1998, spoke to BBC News ahead of its yearly update about the secret of its success, tackling challenges, and the series' future. Pokémon Day is an annual livestream showcasing upcoming releases, upgrades and events. Fans got an extended look at upcoming Nintendo Switch title Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and learned it would be released later this year. There was also a first glimpse of Pokémon Champions - an upcoming mobile game that appeared to be inspired by the Stadium series focused on battles. And the company also showed off additions to the digital and physical versions of its trading card game. Mr Ishihara wasn't giving away too much ahead of the event but says the company's long-term goal is to \"enrich both the real world and the virtual world\". Pokémon GO - the company's successful mobile phone app that works with a device's GPS to place monsters in the real world - is an example of this. \"This is what I think is the biggest strength of Pokémon, and it's important for us to come up with this kind of idea,\" he says. \"So that's how I think of what we want to achieve next.\" One of the hottest topics among long-term Pokémon fans today is scalpers. The resurgence of the collectible card game has caught the attention of resellers who buy up new packs in the hope of landing rare, valuable cards. YouTuber Logan Paul switched a lot of people on to the potential profits of the hobby when he paid $5.3m (£3.9m) for the most expensive Pokémon card ever. Gaming companies have long had an issue with the second-hand market, and Mr Ishihara says it \"prevents new products from being sold\". \"When the second hand market becomes more valuable because of rarity, that is problematic because our business is affected.\" Fans have suggested The Pokémon Company could produce a greater volume of hard-to-find or limited-run items but Mr Ishihara says it cannot do much to control the resale market. \"Those items are seen to be valuable because they're rare or seen as vintage – and it's not our place to say that they're not,\" he says. On the topic of counterfeit products Mr Ishihara is more direct, and says the company's legal teams have fought \"rigorously\" against clones and fakes since the beginning. It recently won a long legal battle against the Chinese company behind a copycat mobile app. And earlier this year it joined Nintendo to sue the makers of Palworld - an online multiplayer survival game described as \"Pokémon with guns\". It alleges developer Pocketpair infringed patents, which it has denied. Pokémon has continued to bring new fans to the franchise by expanding into anime, card games, movies and toys alongside its video game titles. Mr Ishihara says fans now \"span several generations\" and believes \"the biggest reason behind their success is the fact that Pokémon became a tool of communication\". Last weekend, about 13,000 Pokémon fans headed to the European leg of the International Championships at London's Excel Centre. It demonstrates Mr Ishihara's point that people have found their way into the series through various means. Fans Justin, 25, and Marina, 28, who turned up to the event in Team Rocket costumes, tell BBC News they got into Pokémon by watching the animated TV show as children. \"I just loved all the designs, all the different characters,\" says Justin. \"They were just really really cute.\" Marina says in-person events have become a chance for her to meet fellow fans. \"I always used to want to go to conventions and these sorts of events. \"So being able to be here and network and make friends has been such a blessing,\" she says. The Pokémon Company is unusual because it is a private company. Other well-known Japanese brands, such as Nintendo and Hello Kitty maker Sanrio, are publicly traded and answerable to shareholders. Mr Ishihara believes this allows his company to keep a single-minded focus on one thing. \"Pokémon is the only thing we do at the Pokémon Company,\" he says. \"So whatever profit we make from Pokémon gets reinvested in Pokémon.\" He adds that this means the company doesn't have to field questions about expanding or creating new characters from shareholders. \"Our answer will be: 'We'll go bust when Pokémon is no longer popular'. \"I don't think they will like that.\" At the end of 2023, longtime hero Ash Ketchum and his best pal Pikachu bowed out of the animated Pokémon series. The series has continued without the well-loved duo, but one of the \"hardest questions\" Mr Ishihara gets asked is what they're up to now. \"Even though the TV camera may not be following them, Ash's journey is continuing and his partner Pikachu is right next to him.\" With the franchise set to mark its 30th anniversary next year, rumours are already beginning to swirl about special plans for the occasion. Remakes or re-releases of the original Game Boy games are high on many fans' wishlists. Mr Ishihara doesn't have much to say on that at the moment, but wants to maintain a focus on \"connecting the real and virtual worlds\". \"If we continue focusing on our mission, Pokémon can probably continue to its 50th or 100th anniversary,\" he says. \"But if we become complacent and go with the flow, that's when Pokémon will go downhill.\" Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

        "summary": "Ethan Kross is a world expert in the psychology of emotions, and he has identified a set of tools that can help us to tend our wellbeing.",
        "content": "Ethan Kross is a world expert in the psychology of emotions, and he has identified a set of tools that can help us to tend our wellbeing. Ever since he was a child, Ethan Kross has been \"an observer of emotion\" and the often counter-productive ways that we deal with difficult feelings. \"It seemed as if we were all just stumbling along, occasionally finding an accidental or Band-Aid solution to help us manage our emotional lives. Sometimes our improvised tools helped. Sometimes they made things worse. It seemed so haphazard, isolating, and inefficient,\" he says. As a psychologist at the University of Michigan and director of the Emotion and Self-Control Laboratory, Kross hopes to change this sorry state of affairs. In his new book Shift: How to Manage Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You, he aims to equip us all with a set of tools that will help us to navigate our ups and downs more constructively. Kross spoke to science writer David Robson about the benefits of \"negative\" feelings, creating safe spaces and emotional oases – and the surprising upsides of distraction. What are the most common misconceptions about emotions? One big misunderstanding is that there are good emotions and there are bad emotions and that we should strive to live our lives free of all the bad emotions. This is an error, as far as I'm concerned: we evolved the ability to experience all emotions for a reason. Anger can motivate us to correct an injustice if there's still an opportunity to fix things. Sadness can lead us to introspect and make new meaning out of situations that have fundamentally been altered. Envy can motivate us to strive for things that we want to achieve. In the right proportions – that is such a key phrase – all emotions are useful. One way of driving this point home is to think about physical pain, which is about as negative an emotional state as we can imagine. Many of us yearn to live lives free of any kind of physical pain. But some people are born without the capacity to experience pain, due to a genetic anomaly, and those kids end up dying younger than people who can experience pain. If they get their hand stuck in the fire, there's no signal that tells them to pull the hand away. The same principle is true for all our negative emotions. People often find it liberating to know that they don't have to strive to live a life without negativity. What you want to strive to achieve is just keeping these emotional experiences in check, and I think that's a much more tenable goal. Many people believe that their emotions are beyond their control. Where do you think this defeatist attitude comes from? And what are the consequences? I think it depends on the facet of our emotional experiences that we're talking about. We often don't have control over the thoughts and feelings that are automatically triggered as we live our lives throughout the day, but we can control how we engage with those thoughts and feelings once they're activated, and that's where the promise of emotion regulation resides. But if you don't think you can do something, then you're not going to make the effort to practice it. If you don't think exercising is going to make you more fit, for example, why on Earth would you devote effort to exercising? And if you don't think that you can use different strategies to manage your emotions, why would you ever avail yourself of them? So how can we change our responses to difficult feelings? Listening to music is one example of a tool that's underutilised. If you ask people why they listen to music, almost 100% of participants will say that they like the way it makes them feel. But if you then look at what people do when they are struggling with their emotions – such as the last time they were angry, anxious or sad – only a small minority report using music. It's just one category of what I call \"shifters\", which are the tools that can push our emotions around. And once you know how they work, you can be a lot more strategic in how you use them in your life. You also describe how a change in environment can boost our wellbeing. We might have experienced this on holiday, but how can we apply this principle to our day-to-day lives? As you say, a lot of people feel restored when they go to an entirely different place that is free of associations with work. But we can't always take that vacation, and what I like to remind people is that there are often places locally that can shift our mood. We talk a lot about getting attached to other people, and when things aren't going well, being in the presence of that figure can be a source of comfort and resilience. But it turns out we also become attached to places in our environment. Mine include the arboretum near my home, the tea house where I wrote my first book and one of my offices on campus. From the moment I am in that space, I have positive associations that help me manage my emotions. I think that they're not unlike the safe houses you have in spy movies or books. We all have these safe houses in our lives, and we want to be strategic about going to them when we're struggling. It's a way of managing ourselves from the outside in. You can also curate your environment. We know that plants and images of green spaces can be restorative. So can photos of loved ones. We've done research where we expose people to pictures of loved ones while they're struggling with a problem. We find it speeds up the rate at which they \"repair\" following the experience. Is the aim to be more conscious of what we can do to change how we're feeling – rather than just leaving it to chance? One of my hopes for this book is that we can get people to be much more deliberate about incorporating these tools into our lives. I was surprised to find that distraction and avoidance can be a productive way of dealing with emotions. How so? Avoidance – trying actively not to think about something by distracting yourself or engaging in other behaviours – is generally derided as an unhealthy tool. And there's no question that chronically avoiding things has been linked with negative outcomes; it's not an approach that I would advocate for anyone to adopt. But we do not have to choose between either approaching or avoiding our emotions; we can be flexible and do both. There's research showing that people who are effective at both approaching and avoiding their emotions, expressing and suppressing, often fare well in the long term. What might that look like in our lives? Well, let's say you're triggered by something. You get emotional about an argument you have had with someone. One approach might be to address it right there at that moment, but it might make sense to take some time away from thinking about that problem or confronting it. I say that as the kind of person who, in general, does like to confront things right in the moment, just get to the bottom of it, and move on. But sometimes I've benefited from immersing myself in something totally unrelated for a day and then coming back to the problem. I might come back and realise it's not a problem at all, or I'll find that the intensity of the problem is diminished, and I can approach it from a broader perspective. How should we deal with that killer of joy, social comparison? We often hear that we shouldn't compare ourselves to other people. Good luck! We're a social species; part of the way we make sense of ourselves and our place in this world is to compare ourselves to others.  It is true that we often engage in the kinds of comparisons that lead us to feel bad about ourselves, but you can reframe it in ways that make the comparison work for you rather than against you. If I find out that someone is outperforming me, I can say to myself, well, they were able to achieve that, so why can't I? Now it's almost like a target for something that I can shoot towards. More like this: • Why we need to be more emotional to save the world • The untranslatable emotions you never knew you had • How climate change effects mental health Do you have a favourite strategy that you would typically turn to in times of difficulty? When I'm struggling, my first line of defence is to use distanced self-talk. I'll use my name and the second person pronoun – you – to silently coach myself through a problem, as if I'm advising a friend. (Read more: Illeism: The ancient trick to help you think more wisely.) And then I'll also engage in mental time travel. I'll ask myself, 'How am I going to feel about this in a day, 10 days, 10 months from now?' And I'll also go back in time. 'How does this compare to other difficult things I've been through?' Oftentimes, those tools get me to where I want to be emotionally, but if they're not sufficient, I'll go to my emotional advisors, people in my network who are pretty skilled at empathising with me and advising me. And I'll go for a walk in a green space, or visit one of my emotional oases. *Ethan Kross's new book Shift: Managing Your Emotions So They Don't Manage You is published by Vermilion (UK) and Crown (US). ** David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author.

        "headline": "Did Iron Age 'begin' in India? Tamil Nadu dig sparks debate",
        "author": "Soutik Biswas",
        "published_date": "1 day ago",
        "summary": "Tamil Nadu’s iron artefacts may predate Turkey's Anatolia, reshaping early Iron Age history.",
        "content": "For over 20 years, archaeologists in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu have been unearthing clues to the region's ancient past. Their digs have uncovered early scripts that rewrite literacy timelines, mapped maritime trade routes connecting India to the world and revealed advanced urban settlements - reinforcing the state's role as a cradle of early civilisation and global commerce. Now they've also uncovered something even older - evidence of what could be the earliest making and use of iron. Present-day Turkey is one of the earliest known regions where iron was mined, extracted and forged on a significant scale around the 13th Century BC. Archaeologists have discovered iron objects at six sites in Tamil Nadu, dating back to 2,953–3,345 BCE, or between 5,000 to 5,400 years old. This suggests that the process of extracting, smelting, forging and shaping iron to create tools, weapons and other objects may have developed independently in the Indian subcontinent. \"The discovery is of such a great importance that it will take some more time before its implications sink in,\" says Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, a professor of South Asian archaeology at Cambridge University. The latest findings from Adichchanallur, Sivagalai, Mayiladumparai, Kilnamandi, Mangadu and Thelunganur sites have made local headlines such as \"Did the Iron Age Begin in Tamil Nadu?\" The age marks a period when societies began using and producing iron widely, making tools, weapons and infrastructure. Parth R Chauhan, a professor of archaeology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (ISSER), urges caution before drawing broad conclusions.  He believes that iron technology likely emerged \"independently in multiple regions\". Also, the \"earliest evidence remains uncertain because many regions of the world have not been properly researched or archaeological evidence is known but has not been dated properly\". If the Tamil Nadu discovery is further validated through rigorous academic study, \"it would certainly rank amongst the world's earliest records\", Mr Chauhan says. Oishi Roy, an archaeologist at ISSER, adds that the find \"suggests parallel developments [in iron production] across different parts of the world\". Early iron came in two forms - meteoritic and smelted. Smelted iron, extracted from ore, marked the true beginning of iron technology with mass production. The earliest known iron artefacts - nine tubular beads - were made from meteoritic iron, which comes from fallen meteorites. Identifying iron-bearing rocks is the first challenge. Once located, these ores must be smelted in a furnace at extremely high temperatures to extract the metal. Without this process, raw iron remains locked within the rock. After extraction, skilled ironsmiths shape the metal into tools and implements, marking a crucial step in early ironworking. Most sites in Tamil Nadu where iron has been found are ancient habitation areas near present-day villages. Archaeologists K Rajan and R Sivanantham say that excavators have so far explored a fraction of over 3,000 identified Iron Age graves containing sarcophagi (stone coffins) and a wealth of iron artefacts. In the process, they uncovered hoe-spades, spears, knives, arrowheads, chisels, axes and swords made of iron. At burials excavated at one site, over 85 iron objects - knives, arrowhead, rings, chisels, axes and swords - were found inside and outside burial urns. More than 20 key samples were robustly dated in five labs worldwide, confirming their antiquity. Some finds are particularly striking. Historian Osmund Bopearachchi of the Paris-based French National Centre for Scientific Research highlights a key discovery - an iron sword from a burial site, made of ultra-high-carbon steel and dating to 13th–15th Century BC. This advanced steel, a direct evolution of Iron Age metallurgy, required sophisticated knowledge and precise high-temperature processes. \"We know that the first signs of real steel production date back to the 13th Century BC in present-day Turkey. The radiometric dates seem to prove that the Tamil Nadu samples are earlier,\" he said. Ms Roy adds that the early steel in Tamil Nadu indicates the people there \"were iron makers, not just users - a technologically advanced community evolving over time\". Also, in a site called Kodumanal, excavators found a furnace, pointing to an advanced iron-making community. The furnace area stood out with its white discolouration, likely from extreme heat. Nearby, excavators found iron slag - some of it fused to the furnace wall - hinting at advanced metalworking techniques. Clearly the people at the site were not just using iron, but actively producing and processing it. To be sure, the Tamil Nadu excavations are not the first in India to uncover iron. At least 27 sites across eight states have revealed evidence of early iron use, some dating back 4,200 years. The latest Tamil Nadu digs pushes back the antiquity of Indian iron by another 400 years,\" archaeologist Rajan, who has co-authored a paper on the subject, told me. \"The Iron Age is a technological shift, not a single-origin event - it develops in multiple places independently,\" says Ms Roy, noting earlier discoveries in eastern, western and northern India. \"What's clear now,\" she adds, \"is that indigenous iron technology developed early in the Indian subcontinent.\" Experts say the excavations in Tamil Nadu are significant and could reshape our understanding of the Iron Age and iron smelting in the Indian subcontinent. Also, \"what these digs testify is to the existence of a distinctly sophisticated style of civilisation,\" notes Nirmala Lakshman, author of The Tamils - A Portrait of a Community. However, archaeologists caution that there is still a lack of excavations needed to collect fresh data from all over India. As one expert put it, \"Indian archaeology is in silent mode outside Tamil Nadu.\" Katragadda Paddayya, a leading Indian archaeologist, said this was \"just the starting point\". \"We need to delve deeper into the origins of iron technology - these findings mark the beginning, not the conclusion. The key is to use this as a premise, trace the process backward and identify the sites where iron production truly began.\" In many cases, courts criticised the police for lapses in investigation, even \"falsely implicating\" people.

        "headline": "The 'hero' ship fixing Africa's internet blackouts - the BBC goes aboard",
        "author": "Daniel Dadzie",
        "published_date": "1 day ago",
        "summary": "The BBC joins a mission aboard the Léon Thévenin to repair an undersea fibre optic cable.",
        "content": "A ship the size of a football field, crewed by more than 50 engineers and technicians, cruises the oceans around Africa to keep the continent online. It provides a vital service, as last year's internet blackout showed when internet cables buried deep under the sea were damaged. Millions from Lagos to Nairobi were plunged into digital darkness: messaging apps crashed and banking transactions failed. It left businesses and individuals struggling. It was the Léon Thévenin which fixed the multiple cable failures. The ship, where a BBC team recently spent a week on board off the coast of Ghana, has been doing this specialised repair work for the last 13 years \"Because of me, countries stay connected,\" Shuru Arendse, a cable jointer from South Africa who has been working on the ship for more than a decade, tells the BBC. \"IT people at home have work because I bring the main feed in,\" he says. \"You have heroes that save lives - I'm a hero because I save communication.\" His pride and passion reflect the sentiment of the skilled crew on the Léon Thévenin, which stands eight floors high and carries an assortment of equipment. The internet is a network of computers servers - to read this article it is likely that at least one of 600 fibre optic cables across the world collected the data to present it on your screen. Most of these servers are in data centres outside of Africa and the fibre optic cables run along the ocean floor linking them to coastal cities on the continent. Data travels through hair-thin fibreglass wires, often grouped in pairs and protected by different layers of plastic and copper depending on how close the cables are to the shore. \"As long as the servers aren't in the country, you need a connection. A cable runs from one country to the next, linking users to servers that store their data - whether it's accessing Facebook or any other online service,\" says Benjamin Smith, the Léon Thévenin's deputy chief of mission. Undersea fibre optic cables are designed to work for 25 years with minimal maintenance, but when they are damaged, it is usually due to human activity. \"The cable generally doesn't break on its own unless you're in an area where there are pretty high currents and very sharp rocks,\" says Charles Heald, who is in charge of the ship's remotely operated vehicle (ROV). \"But most of the time it's people anchoring where they shouldn't and fishing trawlers sometimes scrape along the seabed, so typically we would see scars from trawling.\" Mr Smith also says natural disasters cause damage to cables, especially in parts of the continent with extreme weather conditions. He gives an example of the seas off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Congo River empties into the Atlantic. \"In the Congo Canyon, where they have a lot of rainfall and low tide, it could create currents that damage the cable,\" he says. Deliberate sabotage is difficult to identify - but the Léon Thévenin crew say they not seen any obvious evidence of this themselves. A year ago, three critical cables in the Red Sea - Seacom, AAE-1 and EIG - were severed, reportedly by a ship's anchor, disrupting connectivity for millions across East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique. Just a month later, in March 2024, a separate set of breaks in the Wacs, Ace, Sat-3, and MainOne cables off the coast of West Africa caused severe internet blackouts across Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia. Anything that required the internet to function felt the strain as repairs stretched on for weeks. Then in May, yet another setback: the Seacom and Eassy cables suffered damage off the coast of South Africa, hitting connectivity in multiple East African nations once again. Such faults are detected by testing electricity and signal strength transmitted through cables. \"There may be 3,000 volts in a cable and suddenly it drops to 50 volts, this means there's a problem,\" explains Loic Wallerand, the ship's chief of mission. There are local teams with the capacity to deal with faults in shallow waters, but if they are detected beyond a depth of 50m (164ft), the ship is called into action. Its crew can fix cables deeper than 5,000m below sea level. The repair witnessed by the BBC off Ghana took over a week to deal with, but most internet users did not notice as traffic was redirected to another cable. The nature of every repair depends on the part of the cable that is damaged. If the fibreglass at the core breaks, it means the data cannot travel along the network and needs to be sent to another cable. But some African countries have only one cable serving them. This means a cable damaged this way leaves the affected area without the internet. At other times, the protective layers of the fibre could be damaged, meaning data transmission still occurs, but with a lower efficiency. In both cases, the crew must find the exact location of the damage. In the case of broken fibreglass, a light signal is sent through the cable and through its point of reflection, the crew can determine where the break is. When the problem is with the cable's insulation - known as a \"shunt fault\" - it becomes more complicated and an electrical signal has to be sent along the cable to physically track where it is lost. After narrowing down the possible area for the fault, the operation moves to the ROV team. Built like a bulldozer, the ROV, weighing 9.5 tonnes, is lowered under water from the ship where it is guided down to the ocean floor. About five crew members work with a crane operator to deploy it - once it is released from its harness, called the umbilical cord, it floats gracefully. \"It doesn't sink,\" says Mr Heald, explaining how it uses four horizontal and vertical thrusters to move in any direction. The ROV's three cameras allow the team onboard to look for the precise location of faults as it moves to the ocean bed. Once found, the ROV cuts the affected part using its two arms, then ties it to a rope that is dragged back to the ship. Here the faulty section is isolated and replaced by splicing and joining it to a new cable - a process that looks like welding and which took 24 hours in the case of the operation witnessed by the BBC. Afterwards the cable was carefully lowered back to the ocean bed and then the ROV made one final journey to inspect that it was well placed and take coordinates so maps could be updated. When an alert is received about a damaged cable, the Léon Thévenin crew is ready to sail within 24 hours. However, their response time depends on several factors: the ship's location, the availability of spare cables and bureaucratic challenges. \"Permits can take weeks. Sometimes we sail to the affected country and wait offshore until the paperwork is sorted,\" Mr Wallerand says. On the average, the crew spends more than six months at sea every year. \"It's part of the job,\" says Captain Thomas Quehec. But talking to the crew members between tasks, it is hard to ignore their personal sacrifices. They are drawn from different backgrounds and nationalities: French, South African, Filipino, Malagasy and more. Adrian Morgan, the ship's chief steward from South Africa, has missed five consecutive wedding anniversaries. \"I wanted to quit. It was difficult to stay away from my family, but my wife encouraged me. I do it for them,\" he says. Another South African, maintenance fitter Noel Goeieman, is worried he may miss his son's wedding in a few weeks if the ship is called out to another mission. \"I've heard we might go to Durban [in South Africa]. My son is going to be very sad because he doesn't have a mum,\" says Mr Goeieman, who lost his wife three years ago. \"But I'm retiring in six months,\" he adds with a smile. Despite the emotional toll, there is camaraderie onboard. When off-duty, crew members are either playing video games in the lounge or sharing meals in the ship's mess hall. Their entry into the profession is as diverse as their background. While Mr Goeieman followed his father's footsteps, chief cook, South African Remario Smith, went to sea to escape a life of crime. \"I was involved in gangs when I was younger,\" Mr Smith says, \"My child was born when I turned 25, and I knew I had to change my life.\" Like the others onboard he is appreciative of the role the ship plays on the continent. \"We are the link between Africa and the world,\" says chief engineer Ferron Hartzenberg.

        "content": "Pop star Katy Perry will blast off into space as part of an upcoming all-women flight on Blue Origin's New Shepherd rocket. The Firework singer will be joined by Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos's fiancee Lauren Sanchez, CBS presenter Gayle King, former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn. Blue Origin said this is the first all-women space flight to take place since the Soviet Union's Valentina Tereshkova's solo mission in 1963. There is no specific date for the launch, but Blue Origin said it would take place this spring. Katy Perry is scheduled to be on her Lifetimes Tour from 23 April until 11 November, so this trip is expected to take place before that. \"If you had told me I'd be part of the first all-female crew in space, I would have believed you. Nothing was beyond my imagination as a child,\" Perry said in a statement cited by Newsweek. The NS-31 mission will be the 11th human spaceflight for the New Shepherd rocket and the 31st in its history. So far, the programme has launched 52 people into space. A trip on the New Shepard typically lasts about 11 minutes, according to Blue Origin. It is fully autonomous - which means there are no pilots - and takes the passengers past the Karman line, internationally recognised as the edge of space. Blue Origin credited Lauren Sanchez for bringing the mission together, saying in its press release that she is \"honored to lead a team of explorers on a mission that will challenge their perspectives of Earth, empower them to share their own stories, and create lasting impact that will inspire generations to come\". Sanchez first announced her plan to fly with an all-women crew on a Blue Origin rocket in 2023 in an interview with Vogue, saying they were \"paving the way for women\". This is the latest group of celebrities to embark on a flight to space. Bezos himself flew on the company's first manned mission in 2021. Good Morning America's co-host Michael Strahan and Star Trek actor William Shatner have also been blasted into space on one of Bezos's rockets.

        "headline": "Amazon joins quantum race with 'cat qubit' powered chip",
        "author": "Chris Vallance",
        "published_date": "16 hours ago",
        "summary": "The prototype chip it dubs Ocelot follows similar announcements by Microsoft and Google",
        "content": "Amazon has become the third tech giant in as many months to announce a breakthrough in quantum computing - a technology that promises vast processing power but is beset by technical difficulties. The firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on \"cat qubit\" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous \"Schrödinger's cat\" thought experiment. The chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free. Amazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought. But how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts. Oskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an \"aggressive date\" of a decade was now \"looking more and more realistic\". \"Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years\", he said but added \"this timeline's come in quite a bit.\" Ultimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business. \"You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,\" he explained. Quantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics. Quantum computers won't replace so-called \"classical\" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines. But that potential is being held up by the problem of errors. Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected. Cat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses. Qubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today. Cat qubits are named in honour of Erwin Schrödinger, whose cat-in-a-box question in 1935 helped illuminate some of the thinking behind quantum theory. Amazon believes the new chip, which has just five cat qubits out of a total of 14 key components, could reduce the costs of correcting quantum errors by up to 90%, compared to current approaches. The technology of cat qubits isn't exclusive to Amazon, a French company named Alice & Bob carried out pioneering work on the tech and continues to evolve the technology. Mazyar Mirrahimi director of research at the French national technology research institute, Inria said Ocelot was \"an important step forward towards hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation\". Amazon believes the new chip offers a path to scaling up to more powerful machines with this type of error proofing built in, but researchers admit there are many challenges ahead. Michael Cuthbert director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre welcomed the progress Amazon had made but told the BBC it remained to be seen the effect it would have on the speed with which the industry is able to develop really useful quantum computers: \"Error correction is a vital step necessary in the long-term development of quantum computing. It is the crucial step that turns quantum computing into a practical and commercial tool we can use to solve complex problems in chemistry, materials science, medicine, logistics and energy.\" \"Part of the challenge is how to scale the revolutionary technology efficiently – mechanisms that enable error correction without huge overheads in chip size, energy consumption and systems complexity are really welcome.\" Amazon researchers have published their findings in a research paper in the scientific journal Nature Amazon joins Microsoft and Google in announcing a new experimental chip. But is this flurry of announcements the result of clever research or clever PR? Or is it  coincidence, the tech equivalent of the saying buses always come in threes? Heather West follows the quantum computing industry as a research manager for the International Data Corporation and was briefed on the new chip by Amazon in advance of publication. She describes Amazon's results as an \"advancement\" rather than a breakthrough. All three recent announcements have focused on reducing errors, and she tells me the industry is \"pivoting\" from a focus on the number of qubits to a focus the \"ability to use these these systems at scale to solve real world life problems. And by doing so we need to be able to solve the error correction within the quantum systems\". However Mr Painter agreed \"100%\" that it wouldn't be easy to scale up today's experimental systems.

        "content": "Stargazers will be treated to a rare alignment of seven planets on 28 February when Mercury joins six other planets that are already visible in the night sky. Here's why it matters to scientists. Peer up at the sky on a clear night at the end of February and you could be in for a treat. Through out January and February six planets – Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune – have been visible in the night sky. During just one night – 28 February – they will be joined by Mercury, a rare seven-planet alignment visible in the sky. It is a spectacle that will not be visible again until 2040. But such events are not just a treat for stargazers – they can also have a real impact on our Solar System and offer the opportunity to gain new insights about our place within it. The eight major planets of our Solar System orbit the Sun in the same flat plane, and all at different speeds. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, completes an orbit – a year for the planet – in 88 days. Earth's year, of course, is 365 days, while at the upper end, Neptune takes a whopping 60,190 days, or about 165 Earth years, to complete a single revolution of our star. The different speeds of the planets mean that, on occasion, several of them can be roughly lined up on the same side of the Sun. From Earth, if the orbits line up just right, we can see multiple planets in our night sky at the same time. In rare events, all the planets will line up such that they all appear in our night sky together along the ecliptic, the path traced by the Sun. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are all bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, while Uranus and Neptune require binoculars or a telescope to spot. In January and February 2025, it has been possible to witness this event taking place. The planets are not exactly lined up, so they appear in an arc across the sky due to their orbital plane in the Solar System. During clear nights, all of the planets except Mercury should be visible – an event sometimes called a planetary parade. On 28 February, though – weather permitting – all seven planets will be visible, a great spectacle for observers on the ground. \"There is something special about looking at the planets with your own eyes,\" says Jenifer Millard, a science communicator and astronomer at Fifth Star Labs in the UK. \"Yes, you can go on Google and get a more spectacular view of all these planets. But when you're looking at these objects, these are photons that have travelled millions or billions of miles through space to hit your retinas.\" While fascinating to observe, do such alignments have any impact here on Earth? Or might they have a use for increasing our understanding of our Solar System and beyond? In fact, says Millard, \"it's just happenstance that they happen to be in this position of their orbits\". And while there have been suggestions from some scientists that planetary alignments might cause impacts on Earth, the scientific basis for most of these claims is weak or non-existent. In 2019, however, researchers suggested that planetary alignments could have an impact on solar activity. One of the main outstanding questions about the Sun is what drives its 11-year cycle between periods of peak activity, known as solar maximum (which we are currently in), and periods of weakest activity, solar minimum. Frank Stefani, a physicist at Helmholtz-Zentrum research centre in Dresden-Rossendorf in Germany, believes the combined tidal forces of Venus, Earth and Jupiter could be the answer. While the tidal pull of each planet on the Sun is extremely small, Stefani says that when two or more of the planets line up with the Sun – known as a syzygy – they might combine to cause small rotations inside the star, called Rossby waves, which can drive weather events. \"On Earth, Rossby waves cause cyclones and anticyclones,\" says Stefani. \"We have the same Rossby waves in the Sun.\" Stefani's calculations showed that the alignments of Venus, Earth and Jupiter would cause a periodicity to solar activity of 11.07 years, almost exactly matching the length of solar cycles that we see. Not everyone is so sure about the idea, with some noting that solar activity can already be explained by processes within the Sun alone. \"The observational evidence suggests that the planets directly causing the solar cycle just doesn't happen,\" says Robert Cameron, a solar scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System research in Germany, who published a paper on the subject in 2022. \"There's no evidence of any synchronisation.\" But there are other, far less contentious, quirks of planetary alignments which certainly do have an impact on us: their usefulness for scientific observations, particularly in terms of exploring the Solar System. Reaching the outer planets with a spacecraft is difficult because these worlds are so far away, billions of miles, and would take decades to reach. However, using the gravitational pull of a well-placed planet, such as Jupiter, to slingshot a spacecraft outwards can reduce the travel time dramatically, something no spacecraft has done better than Nasa's Voyager vehicles. In 1966, a Nasa scientist called Gary Flandro calculated that there would be an alignment of the four outermost planets – Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune – in 1977 that would enable all four to be visited within a span of just 12 years, compared to 30 years if they were not aligned. This fortuitous alignment, which occurs only once every 175 years, led to Nasa launching the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft in 1977 on a \"Grand Tour\" of the outer Solar System. Voyager 1 flew past Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, eschewing Uranus and Neptune because scientists wanted to fly past Titan, Saturn's fascinating moon, and could not do so without ruining the slingshot effect. But Voyager 2 used the alignment to visit all four planets, becoming the only spacecraft in history to visit Uranus and Neptune, in 1986 and 1989 respectively. \"That worked out fantastic,\" says Fran Bagenal, an astrophysicist at the University of Colorado, Boulder in the US and a member of the Voyager science team. \"If Voyager 2 had left in 1980, it would have taken until 2010 to get to Neptune. I don't think it would have won support. Who's going to fund such a thing?\" It is not just within our Solar System that planet alignments are useful. Astronomers use alignments to probe many different aspects of the Universe, and none more so than in the discovery and study of exoplanets, worlds that orbit stars other than the Sun. The dominant way of finding such worlds is known as the transit method: when an exoplanet passes in front of a star from our point of view it dims the star's light, allowing its size and orbit to be discerned. Thanks to this method, we have discovered many planets in orbit around certain stars. Trappist-1, a red dwarf star located 40 light-years from Earth, has seven Earth-sized planets that all transit the star from our point of view. The planets in that system are actually in resonance with each other – meaning the outermost planet completes two orbits for every three orbits of the next planet inwards, then four, six, and so on. This means there are periods where multiple planets in the system align in a straight line, something that doesn't happen in our Solar System. Using transits, we can study the existence of atmospheres on planets like these. \"If a planet with an atmosphere goes in front of a star, that alignment means the starlight goes through the planet, and the molecules and atoms in the planet's atmosphere absorb light at certain wavelengths,\" says Jessie Christiansen, an astronomer at the Nasa Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology. This allows different gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen to be identified. \"The vast majority of our atmospheric composition analysis is due to alignments,\" she says. Much grander alignments can let us probe the distant Universe, namely the alignments of galaxies. Observing galaxies in the very early universe is difficult because they are so faint and far away. However, if a large galaxy or cluster of galaxies passes between our line of sight with a much more distant early galaxy, its large gravitational pull can magnify the light of the more distant object, allowing us to observe and study it, a process called gravitational lensing. \"These are huge alignments across the scale of the universe,\" says Christiansen. They are used by telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope to observe remote stars and galaxies such as Earendel, the most distant known star from Earth. The light viewed by the telescope from the star came from the first billion years of the 13.7-billion-year-history of the Universe and was visible only because of gravitational lensing. And then there are some more novel uses of alignments, such as probing the existence of extraterrestrial life, in solar systems where the exoplanets pass in front of each other from our point of view. In 2024, graduate student Nick Tusay at Pennsylvania State University in the US used these alignments to look for any spillover communications being sent between worlds of the Trappist-1 system, such as how on Earth we send signals to planets like Mars in our solar system to talk to rovers and spacecraft. \"Any time that two planets are aligned might be interesting,\" says Tusay. On this occasion the searches turned up short. But an alien civilisation looking towards our own Solar System might use similar alignments for the same purpose. While the planetary parade this month depends on your point of view – any two planets in our system can be aligned if you are positioned at the right angle – it's not impossible to imagine someone else on the other end, watching on. \"Perhaps another alien civilisation might see this as an opportunity to conduct their own investigations,\" says Tusay. * This article was originally published on 19 January 2025.

        "content": "The ideal poo is a 'type 3' or 'type 4' – cracked or smooth sausage – delivered once per day. Are you a three-times a day kind of person, or is a trip to the lavatory a more rare and special occasion? And crucially, what does your poo frequency reveal about your health? Sit down, relax, and learn about the science of poop. How often we go for a number two can vary from person to person. Every time we eat, the large intestine contracts and pushes food along the digestive tract. This automatic \"gastro-colic reflex\" results in a the release of hormones that create the urge to poo, otherwise known as a \"call to stool\". Most of us have learnt to suppress this urge, however, meaning that once a day or less has become the new norm. \"We all tend to be too busy to poo,\" says Martin Veysey, a gastroenterologist and general medicine physician based at Canberra Hospital in Australia. Conventionally, it has often been claimed that one poo a day is a sign of good gut health. But in the past it wasn't known what constitutes 'normal' when it comes to bowel movements. One study even implied that anything from one bowel action every few weeks or months to 24 poos a day could be regarded as normal. However, thanks to the pioneering work of scientists like Ken Heaton, a consultant physician at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in the UK, we now known better. In the late 1980s, Keaton and colleagues surveyed residents of East Bristol, asking them the rather impertinent question – how often do you poo? The results revealed a huge variety in bowel movements. Although the most common bowel habit was one poo per day, only 40% of men and 33% of women adhered to this practice. Some defecated less than once a week, others three times a day. Overall, the study concluded that \"conventionally normal bowel function is enjoyed by less than half the population and that, in this aspect of human physiology, younger women are especially disadvantaged\". Incidentally this wasn't the only contribution Heaton made to the science of stools. He later helped devise The Bristol Stool Form Scale, which, with its accompanying illustrations, has become a widely used practical guide to help doctors diagnose digestive problems. The scale features handy descriptions of stools varying from \"separate hard lumps, like nuts\" to \"fluffy pieces with ragged edges\". The NHS and other health bodies state that having a bowel movement between three times a day and three times a week is considered normal. But normal and healthy aren't necessarily the same thing. Scientists might have solved the mystery of how often we poo, but it does nothing to answer the question how often should we poo? Increasingly, researchers are finding that a person's bowel movements are a strong indicator of their health. For example, a 2023 study examined the bowel habits of 14,573 adults in the United States. The most frequent bowel habit was seven times per week (50.7% of people), and the most common poo type was \"like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft\". Researchers then tracked the participants for over five years to see if there was any relationship between stool frequency and mortality. They found that people who pooed four soft stools a week were 1.78 times more likely to die within five years than those who pooed normal stools seven times a week. Infrequent defecators were also 2.42 and 2.27 more likely to die from cancer and cardiovascular disease, respectively. How much is a good amount to poop is also a question occupying Sean Gibbons, a microbiologist at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, the US. In 2024, Gibbons led a study which categorised 1,400 healthy adults into four groups based on their toilet habits; constipated (one-two bowel movements per week); low-normal (three-six bowel movements per week); high-normal (one-three bowel movements per day); and diarrhoea. They then looked to see if there was any association between poo frequency and a person's gut microbiome. Gibbons found that frequent pooers who squeezed out one to three stools a day had a higher proportion of 'good' bacteria residing in their guts than those who visited the lavatory less often. On the flip side of the coin, Gibbons found that people who pooed less than three times a week were more likely to have toxins in their blood that have previously been implicated in conditions such as chronic kidney disease and Alzheimer's. \"In the Goldilocks zone of pooing [the high-normal category], we saw a rise in strictly anaerobic microbes that produce chemicals called short chain fatty acids,\" says Gibbons. One of these short chained fatty acids (SFAs), butyrate, is known to lower inflammation in the body. This is important, because chronic inflammation is now thought to be the driving factor behind conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even Alzheimer's. \"Having higher levels of butyrate also allows you to control glucose levels in your blood better, so you have better insulin sensitivity,\" says Gibbons. \"Butyrate will also bind to cells in the gut, stimulating them to produce hormones that make you feel full,\" he says. Gibbons believes one reason people who were constipated had higher levels of harmful toxins in their blood stream is that when a person has infrequent bowel movements, poo sticks around in their gut for long periods. This causes bacteria in the gut to eat up all of the available fibre, converting it into health-promoting SFAs. The problem, however, is that once all the fibre is gone, the bacteria start fermenting proteins instead – which releases harmful toxins into the bloodstream. These toxins are known to cause damage to organs including the kidneys and heart. One, known as phenylacetylglutamine, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, for example. \"If you have chronically high levels of this metabolite in your circulation, it can promote atherosclerosis, a kind of hardening of the arteries and damage to the cardiovascular system,\" says Gibbons. Gibbons says that even though clinical guidance states that between three stools a day to three poos a week is healthy, his study showed that even in the low-normal stool group there was a rise in toxins in the bloodstream. \"It's hard to say definitively, because we don't have causal data to know whether these people went on to get sick in the future, but it does seem to be the case that, based on what we were looking at, pooping every other day to a couple of times a day is probably a better window to be healthy,\" says Gibbons. However, as ever, correlation is not causation. It is possible that people who are already less healthy in other ways might have less frequent bowel movements, although Gibbon's study tried to control for this by only selecting adults who had no reported health concerns. One measure of the health of your gut is the time it takes for food to travel through your digestive system – known as gut transit time. You can easily test this at home by eating brightly-coloured foods such as sweetcorn, and then timing how long it takes to come out the other end. Generally speaking, the longer a person's gut transit time, the less often they poo, and the more likely they are to suffer constipation. More like this: In 2020, researchers at King's College London gave blue muffins to 863 people to measure their gut transit time. This was part of the Predict1 study – a clinical research project focused on understanding how individual variations in genetics, gut microbiome, and other factors influence how different meals affect blood sugar and fat levels in the body. The study revealed that gut transit times varied widely from person to person, ranging from under 12 hours to many days. Remarkably, the microbes found in the guts of people with short transit times – who tended to defecate more often - differed remarkably from those with longer transit times, with a short transit time associated with a healthier gut microbiome. \"What we found was that people who had a longer transit time tended to have more 'bad' gut bacteria, so bacteria that have previously been linked to having worse heart health and metabolic health,\" says Emily Leeming, a microbiome scientist at King's College London. This finding was most pronounced for people with a gut transit time of 58 hours or more, who tended to poo less than three times a week. Like Gibbons, Leeming suspects that in those whose poo spends longer in the gut, microbes aren't getting a fresh meal – so they end up switching from eating fibre and carbohydrates to proteins. This then produces byproducts which are bad for your health. As well as a healthier gut microbiome, Leeming's study revealed that those with shorter gut transit times benefited from having less visceral fat – a type of fat that lies deep within the belly and surrounds abdominal organs. Visceral fat is dangerous because it can increase your risk of many health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. Finally, people with short gut transit times also displayed healthier responses to food, known as a 'postprandial response'. This means they had lower levels of sugar and lipids in their blood following a meal, lowering their risk of cardiovascular disease. The finding fits with what scientists know about constipation, and its links to chronic disease. If someone is chronically constipated, then they may be at higher risk of things like bowel cancer. However, the evidence to support this is mixed – one meta-analysis, a type of study which combines the results from several others which answer the same question, found that bowel cancer was not more prevalent in constipated individuals. \"But we also seeing links with other parts of the body. For example, people with Parkinson's Disease can have constipation up to 20 years before they show any motor symptoms,\" says Leeming. Veysey, meanwhile, points to the known link between slow bowel transit and gallstones – hard deposits of bile that form in the gallbladder. \"It also raises the risk of developing polyps, pre-cancerous lesions in the bowel, which then can become cancers,\" he says. Rather than the number of bowel movements a week – which can vary from person to person, Leeming says that the key thing to look out for is any unexplained changes in bowel habits. She also advises that it's a good idea to keep track of your regular pooping habits to get to know what's normal for you. \"We should all be looking at our poo, because it's basically like a free gut health test,\" says Leeming. \"It's not just how often you go, it's also colour and the shape of your poo as well. What you're really looking for is type 3 to type 4 [on the Bristol Stool Form Scale], which is basically a sausage with cracks in it, or a smooth sausage.\" As regards colour, if you see any black or red in your stools, that indicates the presence of blood. Although there could be a harmless explanation for this, it could be a sign of colorectal cancer and so it's important to see a doctor as soon as possible. You should also talk to your doctor if you regularly have diarrhoea or need to go very suddenly, or if you experience a lot of cramps, bloating, and gas after eating. Finally, if you'd like to become more \"regular\", there's three simple things you can do. \"In our study, the people in the Goldilocks zone ate more fruits and vegetables, were more hydrated, and were more physically active,\" says Gibbons. -- For trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.

        "content": "Synaesthesia is a neurological condition found to enhance memory and learning. Now, scientists say seeing in colour could help when it comes to learning a second language. My mother's name is the colour of milk. The strings of an acoustic guitar, when strummed, play the warm yellow of honeycomb. The sound is flat, hard and smooth. And Monday is pink. These sensations are always the same, and always present. This is synaesthesia – in my case grapheme-colour synaesthesia, sound-colour synaesthesia and sound-texture synaesthesia. Like many synaesthetes, I discovered at a young age I had a flair for both music and languages. In music, it wasn't the physical act of performing I excelled at, but composition. I went on to become a composer for short films and dance theatre, and a sound editor for television. Writing music felt a lot like a language to me, as I \"saw\" the colours of the sounds in a similar way. I also studied French, German, Spanish and linguistics – the colour of language helping me to remember words as well as the patterns of grammar. Synaesthesia is a neurological phenomenon that causes an estimated 4.4% of people to experience the world as a cacophony of sensations. Around 60 different types of synaesthesia have been identified, but there could be more than 100, with some types experienced in clusters. The condition is thought to be caused by genetically inherited traits that affect the structural and functional development of the brain. Increased communication between sensory regions in the brain means, for example, words can stimulate taste, sequences of numbers may be perceived in spatial arrangements, or the feel of textures might conjure emotions. Synaesthesia is not considered to be a neurological disorder and – although it has been linked to neurodevelopmental and mental health conditions including autism, anxiety and schizophrenia – it is described as an \"alternative perceptual reality\" and generally thought to be beneficial. \"When I was younger I knew I saw the world in a different way, and my way of describing that to others was 'colourful',\" says Smadar Frisch. Frisch, who has grapheme-colour synaesthesia, sound-colour synaesthesia and lexical–gustatory synaesthesia – where words have taste – explores the world of senses through her podcast, Chromatic Minds, and is currently writing her first book on the subject. \"Learning in school was too much for me sensory-wise,\" she says. \"It is very difficult trying to solve an equation when all the colouring of a series of numbers was a psychedelic blast.\" This explosion of colour, says Frisch, would cause her to lose focus and forget what she was doing. \"[It was the] same with language. The words' colours, music and taste sensations ignited me and I wanted to express myself so much – that I lost focus.\" It wasn't until she'd almost finished high school that she came across Richard Cytowic and David Eagleman's book, Wednesday is Indigo blue. \"My initial thought was that Wednesday is actually orange – and I needed to get this book.\" This was a turning point for Frisch. \"I finally understood how my synaesthete brain is linked and wired. And I thought to myself, this phenomenon is amazing. I can use the colours to help me learn, rather than confuse me.\" Frisch developed a colour coding system to help her learn new languages fluently and quickly. Studying languages no longer felt confusing but \"organised\", she says. \"And it worked! My whole world changed. I went on to learn the thing my brain was meant to excel in: languages.\" Frisch says she was able to learn French and Spanish fluently in just two months. \"I scored 90+ on each [French and Spanish] exam,\" she says. Today Frisch can speak seven languages fluently – and says she can learn any language she wants \"with no difficulty, in a short matter of time\". Julia Simner is director of the Multisense Synaesthesia Research laboratory at the University of Sussex in the UK. She and her team tested around 6,000 children who were six to 10 years old. \"We screened each one individually for synaesthesia, and then gave [them] a battery of tests to determine what skills come with synaesthesia,\" she says. The study found that the children with synaesthesia were better in a number of skills than the children without – skills which, according to Simner, would \"certainly help both first and second language learning\". \"Specifically, they were significantly better in receptive vocabulary (how many words they could understand), productive vocabulary (how many words they knew how to say), short term memory store, attention to detail and creativity,\" Simner says. \"These syn-linked skills predict that we might well expect second-language learning to be easier for someone with synaesthesia.\" Having synaesthetic colours, she says, makes letters more memorable. And the synaesthesia colours can pass from one language into the second language learned, making words in the second language more memorable too. \"The way these colours seep across languages can either be via the way the letter looks or the way the letter sounds,\" says Simner. \"It's like the colour scaffolds across from one language to another.\" In 2019, another experiment led by psychologists at the University of Toronto, Canada, found grapheme-colour synaesthesia, where each letter and number has its own distinct colour, provides a significant advantage in statistical learning – allowing a person to \"see\" patterns – an ability critical to language learning. The researchers asked participants to listen to a set of nonsense words – for example, \"muh-keh\" and \"beh-od\" – representing an artificial \"language\". They then listened to a second set of words. This set included the original artificial words, plus new artificial words which represented a \"foreign\" language. The participants were then asked to distinguish \"words\" from each of the two artificial languages. \"It didn't have meaning,\" says Amy Finn, psychologist and director of the University of Toronto's cognitive neuroscience and developmental laboratory, Finn Land Lab. \"It was constructed to look at 'segmentation' – or how you use regularities to pull out what the segments of language even are. This is a very early but super important problem in early language learning.\" The results showed grapheme-colour synaesthetes were better able to differentiate between the two \"languages\" than participants who didn't have synaesthesia. \"We think [synaesthesia] can help you parse the chunks of language more easily,\" says Finn. When synaesthetes experience the same patterns with more than one sense – for example, both aurally and visually – their mind conjures a bonus secondary cue which can help them recognise or remember the pattern. Take 11-year-old me, put on the spot in my first week of secondary school. \"How do you say 'work'?\" demands my French teacher. The class is silent. I know the word is blue. Then it comes to me. \"Travail,\" I answer. Sometimes I can't remember a word – but I can remember the colour. This can be frustrating because no one can help me if I say \"it's pink\", as the colours are unique to my own mind. On the other hand, colour acts as an extra reminder, a bonus cue I can put to use when learning languages. You might think, then, that synaesthesia would be more prevalent in bilingual children. But research suggests that people who learn a second language later than early childhood are more likely to have this sensory-switching ability than those who are natively bilingual. This bolsters the theory that synaesthesia develops as a learning tool. Synaesthesia emerges in childhood, as a child starts to take in the world around them, and they learn to talk, read and write. A 2016 study by researchers in Canada, the US and the Czech Republic found that children learn to categorise colours between ages of four and seven years, around the time they begin learning to read and write, and synaesthesia then begins to emerge from the age of six. The authors of the study surmise: \"Children use their newly-acquired ability to categorise colour as an unorthodox aid in mastering the domain of letters and words.\" However, synaesthesia can, on occasion, make communication more difficult – and the suggestion that synaesthesia might function as a strategy to facilitate learning \"remains a topic of debate\", says Lucie Bouvet, a psychologist at the University of Toulouse, France. More like this: • How synaesthesia inspires artists • The AI that 'tastes' colours • The adventure of raising bilingual children \"Phoneme-colour synaesthesia [is where] all phonemes – the smallest unit of spoken meaning – evoke the perception of specific colours,\" saysBouvet. This is the experience of a woman identified as 'VA' in a 2023 paper co-authored by Bouvet. For instance, every time VA hears a hard \"a\" sound, she sees luminous cyan. Every time she hears \"k\", she sees red. \"VA describes a way of thinking in images, where words function as a second language,\" says Bouvet. \"The colours evoked by phonemes help her to access meaning.\" VA's process of communication is to hear the sounds, then see the colours, then translate meaning from those colours. This double translation effort could cause VA to lose track of conversations. \"In rare cases, individuals may find their synaesthesia overwhelming, feeling that their internal experiences interfere with their perception of the external world,\" explains Bouvet. Whether helpful or not to the synaesthete, research into synaesthesia can help us to understand cognitive processes of language and perception. \"Synaesthesia is an intriguing phenomenon in itself,\" says Bouvet. \"But recent research suggests that it is part of a broader, specific cognitive profile. Identifying this unique cognitive profile may be key to gaining a deeper understanding of synaesthesia.\" For me, living life with a mishmash of sensations brings joy. Listening to music is a fully immersive experience. I sink into an ocean of texture, as if I'm under a soft duvet or submersed in cool water. The words of a book are not just inert ink on a page, but bring the story to life as they swirl around me. And language fills the air in a kaleidoscope of colour. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "Rorschach tests play with the human imagination and our mind's ability to impart meaning onto the world around us – but what does AI see in them? For more than a century, the Rorschach inkblot test has been widely used as a window into people's personality. Even if you haven't done one yourself, you'll recognise the mirrored ink smudges that form ambiguous shapes on cards. Developed by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach in 1921, the test involves showing a number of inkblots to subjects, then asking them to say what they see. The images are deliberately inscrutable and open to interpretation. For decades they were popular among psychologists as a way of understanding a person's psyche from the creatures, objects or scenes they perceive in the shapes. It relies upon a phenomenon known as pareidolia, which is a tendency to find meaningful interpretations in things where there is none. It is the same reason why people see faces or animals in cloud formations or on the surface of the Moon. You might see a butterfly in the image while someone else might see a skull. According to proponents of the test, both interpretations shed light on how you think. While many psychologists today believe the test is now obsolete and has little credibility as a psychometric tool, it is still used in some parts of the world and is even used as part of courtroom evidence, although this is controversial. Rorschach never intended it to be a measure of personality, but rather a way of identifying disordered thinking in patients, such as those with schizophrenia. Some psychologists, however, still believe it is useful as a tool in therapy as a way of encouraging self-reflection or starting conversations. \"When a person interprets a Rorschach image, they unconsciously project elements of their psyche such as fears, desires, and cognitive biases,\" says Barbara Santini, a London-based psychologist, who uses the Rorschach test with her clients. \"The test works because human vision isn't passive, but a meaning-making process shaped by personal experience.\" Finding meaning or familiar shapes in inkblots relies upon a number of cognitive processes that humans use every day, including memory, emotion and the ability to deal with ambiguity. But what happens if you have no personal experience, or you offer it to a \"brain\" that works in an entirely different way? What might an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm recognise in these inkblots? And what would their answers tell us about the human mind? Recent developments in the capabilities of AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT means it's now possible to put that to the test. So-called \"multimodal models\" can accept image-based inputs and provide responses as easily as they are to interact with text-based prompts thanks to their machine vision capabilities. We gave ChatGPT five of the 10 common images used in an inkblot test to see how it would interpret the images. But the AI system's training data – information that helps establish its \"knowledge\", makes it trickier to do so. AI v the Mind This article is part of AI v the Mind, a series that aims to explore the limits of cutting-edge AI and learn a little about how our own brains work along the way. With some expert help, each article pits different AI tools against the human mind, asking probing questions designed to test the limits of intelligence. Can a machine write a better joke than a professional comedian, or unpick a moral conundrum more elegantly than a philosopher? We hope to find out. Showing the AI model the first inkblot card from an online database of inkblots, which is commonly interpreted by humans as a bat, butterfly or moth, highlighted just how literal AI vision algorithms can be. \"This image is a Rorschach inkblot, often used in psychological assessments to explore perception and interpretation,\" the chatbot replied. \"It is designed to be ambiguous so that each person might see something different depending on their experiences, emotions, and imagination.\" Pretence spoiled, it then went on to explain what it saw in the same answer, without me having to prompt it further. \"For me, it resembles something symmetrical, possibly two animals or figures facing each other, or a single entity with wings outstretched,\" the chatbot responded. \"The beauty of these inkblots is that they invite individual interpretations!\" The chatbot then asked me back what I saw in the image – a question I chose to ignore, instead pressing it to see which of the two resemblances it had suggested it thought was most fitting. \"Looking closely, I'd say it most resembles a single entity with wings outstretched – perhaps a bat or a moth, with its wings open symmetrically,\" the chatbot wrote. \"The central area could be interpreted as the body, and the details on the sides evoke the texture or shape of wings.\" \"I think that's just rehearsing what it knows of the specific test,\" says Coen Dekker, a Dutch software developer who a decade ago asked a neural network, an early version of the technology underpinning AI chatbots today, to complete a Rorschach test. (Dekker's experiment was significantly more simplified because of the technical constraints of the neural networks of the time.) \"I believe it mainly identifies patterns, shapes, and textures within the blots, and then compares these features to a vast dataset of human responses to generate its interpretation of what it sees in the inkblots,\" says Ieva Kubiliute, a London-based psychologist. \"ChatGPT provides interesting, human-like responses, but it is likely not genuinely thinking – instead, it appears to be scanning an online dataset,\" says Chandril Ghosh, lecturer in psychology at the University of Kent, in the UK, specialising in mental health, AI and treatment. It's similar to the way a musician who has never experienced heartbreak can still write a song that pulls at your heartstrings, simply by analysing how other similar songs like it are structured. Or as Santini, the psychologist puts it, \"If an AI's response resembles a human's, it's not because it sees the same thing but it's because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture.\" What we get is a facsimile of reality – and of thought. \"ChatGPT can accurately describe emotions without actually experiencing them,\" Ghosh says. That doesn't make AI useless when it comes to matters of the mind, however. \"ChatGPT can understand emotions, describe them, and help others make sense of their feelings,\" he says. Ghosh believes that ChatGPT is simply regurgitating random information from its dataset for the benefit of users – which gives the impression of \"thinking\", but never actually is. Part of the reason why we perceive it possibly as thinking is the way that the tech companies behind these AI chatbots present their products. ChatGPT and tools like it are always helpful, always conscientious, and always conversational. The anthropomorphising of these tools has helped their adoption – but it can muddy the waters around how they – and their outputs – are perceived. One way of uncovering that unreality is by simply pressing the refresh button, says Ghosh. Present ChatGPT with the same inkblot image to analyse, and it may well come up with a totally different interpretation in the same conversation. When we gave ChatGPT the same image twice, the AI did indeed give different responses. \"A human would typically stick to their previous answer because personal experiences and emotions influence their responses,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, ChatGPT generates responses based on its dataset.\" That's part of the problem when trying to infer meaning in what ChatGPT says about the inkblots it sees: the chatbot is simply regurgitating what its training data has encountered. This is perhaps best demonstrated by an experiment by researchers at the MediaLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US. They trained an AI algorithm called \"Norman\" – named after Alfred Hitchcock's character Norman Bates – on images from a Reddit group that shares images of people dying in gruesome circumstances. When they showed Norman a set of Rorschach inkblots, the images it described seeing reflected the darkness it had been trained upon. While an algorithm trained on a more normal set of image data would see a group of birds on a tree branch, Norman described seeing a man being electrocuted. It is a stark illustration of just how important the data used to train an AI can be. Train a model using bad data, and the resulting AI will reflect the flaws in that data. But what an AI chooses to regurgitate in response to ambiguous stimuli is interesting, says Dekker – in part because of what it says, rather than what it \"knows\" (AI systems know nothing innately). \"It has a general understanding of colour theory and what emotional responses these could give when analysed,\" says Dekker. \"I have a feeling it has a general understanding of the images and what people associate it with. This got me thinking: Wouldn't it be cool if we had – or created – a new set of Rorschach-like images which the model does not know about at all, and let it analyse those?\" While this isn't something Dekker is actively pursuing, we know that AI algorithms do have a tendency to \"hallucinate\" and invent information that isn't true. But it is also possible force them to hallucinate too. In one experiment by computer scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US, they were able to 3D print a turtle with a particular colour and texture that fooled a machine vision system into thinking it was a rifle. Similarly, a few stickers on a stop sign can render it invisible to the algorithm – a potential risk for a self-driving car. (Read more about the 'weird events' that make machines hallucinate.) AI algorithms are particularly good at spotting patterns, but those differing responses to a single ambiguous image also highlight an aspect of the human mind that AI can't replicate: the emotions and unconscious meanings we attach to things we encounter in the world around us. There was no subjectivity in what the AI system was saying when presented with the inkblots, Kubiliute says. \"It cannot understand the symbolic meaning or emotional resonance that a human might associate with a particular image.\" And that in itself tells us a lot about the human mind. \"The human psyche is filled with internal conflicts, such as the tension between desires and morals or fears and ambitions,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, AI functions on clear logic and does not struggle with inner dilemmas essential to human thought and decision-making.\" -- For more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.

        "author": "William Park",
        "published_date": "5 days ago",
        "summary": "The qualities that make us stand out the most, and the main reasons that people find us attractive, can be a blessing and a curse. Sometimes they can become a reason for a breakup.",
        "content": "The qualities that make us stand out the most, and the main reasons that people find us attractive, can be a blessing and a curse. Sometimes our most appealing traits can become a reason for a breakup. \"The ick\" was one of the more unusual words to be added to the Cambridge Dictionary in 2024. The phrase describes the feeling of suddenly seeing something about a partner in a new light, and finding it so unattractive it can't be unseen. Once you have the ick, it is unfortunately incurable. While the phrase might be intended in a lighthearted manner, it shows that there can be unattractive qualities about a partner that are not immediately obvious. In fact, we might have found those qualities really attractive earlier in the relationship. This is called \"fatal attraction\" – when a person comes to dislike aspects of a partner that they were initially attracted to. \"It doesn't mean fatal in the sense of deadly, but fatal as in the sense of prophetic,\" says Diane Felmlee, a social psychologist from Penn State University in the US. \"I like to think of it as having 'too much' of an attractive quality,\" she says. \"Disenchantment with a partner can occur even when people get what they want, and perhaps because they get what they want.\" During her own research, Felmlee asks people for reasons they were first attracted to a partner, why they became dissatisfied and why past relationships ended. Most people listed various needs that were not being met by their ex-partner as a cause for a breakup. But Felmlee noticed some of those missed needs were related to reasons they were attracted to an ex-partner in the first place. \"It is a different interpretation of the same quality,\" she says. \"It's a negative way of looking at a positive trait. I have an example here of someone who said they were attracted to their partner because she was considerate. And then they complained that she said 'sorry' too much. Well, that sounds pretty considerate.\" Other examples identified by Felmlee include being attracted to someone with a high-powered job, only to find that they spend too long at work, or finding a partner funny, but then complaining that they don't take life seriously. Easygoing, laid-back partners became flaky or never on time. \"Easygoing is great, as long as you're punctual,\" says Felmlee with a laugh. Likewise, partners who are at first judged to be powerful or strong become controlling or overbearing after a breakup. People who are nice become pushovers. Successful people become workaholics. With fatal attraction, the stronger the initial attraction to a particular characteristic, the more likely it is to become a reason for a breakup. Why might it be that big positives end up being dealbreakers? First, it could be that the things we first notice about new partners, or potential partners, are the extreme qualities that make them stand out. \"We don't describe partners as 'kind of helpful', or 'a little hard working',\" says Felmlee. \"And the more extreme it is, the more likely people are to dislike those qualities later.\" There might be an element of naivety too, adds Felmlee – our initial infatuation temporarily blinds us to the potential downsides of a very extreme characteristic. But after the initial excitement subsides, we become more aware of how those characteristics might have a negative effect. This reevaluation can happen subtly over time. Fatal attraction might be a slow, dawning realisation rather than a drastic reversal in judgment as with the ick. Couples that have been together for between 10 and 21 years have the lowest levels of relationship adjustment, meaning that they find it harder between these ages to resolve conflicts, adjust to new challenges or change their expectations towards their partner. It is important to reevaluate relationship satisfaction because it is a predictor for many aspects of life, according to Samantha Joel, a psychologist at Western University in Ontario, Canada. People in unhappy relationships have poorer physical health, higher blood pressure, are at higher risk of poor mental health and have worse work-life balance, among many other problems. A simple measure of relationship satisfaction, called social exchange theory, can be made by comparing the rewards we receive from being with a partner, such as how much fun we have, if they make us feel prized, their beauty or money, against the costs, such as conflicts, the potential to be hurt or financial investments. There are two ways that people use social exchange theory – firstly by comparing a current relationship to past ones. We will find a relationship less satisfying if it falls below the standard that we expect based on past experiences. The other comparison we might make is with other options available to us currently. We might reject potential partners, even if we think the signs may be promising, if we feel we might have better odds with other people. Those calculations will be different for everyone. Same-sex couples, for example, are likely to face higher relationship costs because of discrimination and homophobia. Depending on where you live, you might have fewer dating options available to you too. So, are we better off being drawn to a middle-of-the-road partner with fewer extremes? \"I don't think so,\" says Felmlee. \"It is probably a better bet to look for someone with similar extremes to us rather than average qualities.\" Couples that are similar in some key traits are more likely to be successful. Looking at a pool of 79,000 British couples, the strongest indicator for relationship satisfaction is being a similar age. But other demographic factors, including education, and some other things like religious or political beliefs and substance use are also strong predictors for relationship success. There are also smaller but still significant correlations between biological factors like being a similar height and BMI. \"We found particularly high correlations for things like beliefs and values, educational attainment, and certainly substance use,\" says Tanya Horwitz, a doctoral student at the University of Colorado Boulder in the US. Similarity seems to be strengthening, but dissimilarity only seems to be a problem in certain circumstances. \"A smaller minority showed any sign of a negative correlation,\" she says. One example which did seem to matter was that morning people really don't seem to be compatible with evening people, and vice versa. Horwitz says that two very different people might still find themselves attracted to each other initially, but they are less likely to be successful long-term. The couples in her study were older, cohabiting, married or co-parenting. \"These were generally people who are in quite serious or long-term relationships, and I think it really says more about what makes for a long-term union, than what makes for an initial attraction,\" she says. Felmlee caveats that fatal attraction doesn't have to be terminal for a relationship. Partners who share similarly strong characteristics might do OK. \"Studying fatal attraction, it's less common for people to complain about the similar qualities that they say they have in themselves,\" she says. One of her interviewees, an older man, said he was first attracted to his wife because of the strength of her character and her confidence. The downside, he said, is that she could sometimes be stubborn. \"But they're still married,\" says Felmlee. \"So what's going on? He also showed an awareness of himself and admitted he could be stubborn too. That was really sweet.\" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "YouTube is about to turn 20. An unusual research method is unveiling statistics about the platform that Google would rather keep hidden. YouTube may not seem secretive. It's public facing. You can watch an endless stream of content from now until your dying breath. There's been a mountain of research about the platform, unpacking everything from the commodified economy that surrounds it to the radicalising effects of its algorithm. But the picture goes blurry when you start asking simple questions. For example: how much YouTube do we all watch? Google, which owns YouTube, is quiet about that and many other details. In February, the company revealed that people who access YouTube on their TVs collectively watch one billion hours a day, but total numbers for the platform are an enigma. Estimates say YouTube has around 2.5 billion monthly users – almost one in three people on Earth – and the average mobile app user watches something like 29 hours a month. With that, let's try some back-of-the-napkin maths. If we make a few assumptions, and say that monthly viewing average for app users can be applied across all YouTube users on both the website and television, we can multiply 2.5 billion by 29 hours. This would tell us that humanity consumes something like 8.3 million years of videos on YouTube every month. Over 12 months, that adds up to almost 100 million years, hundreds of times longer than the sum total of human history. How many YouTube videos are there? What are they about? What languages do YouTubers speak? As of 14 February 2025, the platform's will have been running for 20 years. That is a lot of video. Yet we have no idea just how many there really are. Google knows the answers. It just won't tell you. Experts say that's a problem. For all practical purposes, one of the most powerful communication systems ever created – a tool that provides a third of the world's population with information and ideas – is operating in the dark. In part that's because there's no easy way to get a random sampling of videos, according to Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in the US. You can pick your videos manually or go with the algorithm's recommendations, but an unbiased selection that's worthy of real study is hard to come by. A few years ago, however, Zuckerman and his team of researchers came up with a solution: they designed a computer program that pulls up YouTube videos at random, trying billions of URLs at a time. You might call the tool a bot, but that's probably over selling it, Zuckerman says. \"A more technically accurate term would be 'scraper',\" he says. The scraper's findings are giving us a first-time perspective on what's actually happening on YouTube. In its 20 years of operation, YouTube has shaped entire generations' sensibilities and redefined global culture. Surveys show YouTube is the most popular social media site in the US by far, with 83% of adults and 93% of teenagers among its patrons. It's the second-most-visited website on Earth by most estimates, topped only by Google.com itself. But as the platform enters its third decade, the most basic facts about YouTube are still a closely guarded secret. A Google spokesperson shared a blogpost about the platform's recommendation algorithm, but declined to comment on the statistics and other issues mentioned in this story. For now, YouTube's mysteries continue. \"It's extremely difficult to get a grasp on what's going on inside social media platforms, because while the companies that operate them do make certain public disclosures, those disclosures are fragmentary and often somewhat misleading,\" says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"I think there's an instinct at Google that it's not in their interest to emphasise just how gargantuan YouTube is, how titanic the number of users, how phenomenal the amount of content. Google doesn't want to be seen as influential as it really is.\" But Zuckerman and his colleagues found a way to peek behind the curtain. YouTube URL's have a standard format. With a few exceptions, the addresses begin with \"youtube.com/watch?v=\" and end with a unique string of 11 characters. Gangnam Style's identifier is 9bZkp7q19f0, for example. So, the researchers wrote a program that basically generates 11 random characters and checks if there's a corresponding video. When the scraper finds one, it downloads it. Zuckerman says you can think of it like a pesky teenager, punching in random numbers for prank calls after dipping into his parent's liquor cabinet. \"If I wanted to know how many valid phone numbers there are in New York's 212 area code, I could just dial 212 and seven random numbers to see if somebody answers. I'd probably get cursed out a lot if I did it enough, but eventually I'd gather enough data to figure it out,\" Zuckerman says. \"That's what we did with YouTube. The thing is, YouTube has 18.6 quintillion potential numbers, so you have to dial a few billion before someone picks up.\" So, Zuckerman's lab let the scraper drunk dial YouTube, over and over again, until it put together a big enough data set. To collect the first 10,016 videos they gathered for their initial study, the scraper tried more than 18 trillion potential URLs. It took almost 1.87 billion bad guesses for every real video it found. If you did that work yourself, spending three seconds on each try, it would take an average of 178 years before you landed on a single video. When the researchers analysed their findings, the results challenged the prevailing narrative about what YouTube actually is. The first question was simple. How many videos have people uploaded to YouTube? Google used to release that statistic in the early days, back when YouTube had something to prove. When Google first acquired the platform in 2006, around 65,000 videos were uploaded every day. More recently the company says more than 500 hours are uploaded per minute, but it's tight-lipped about the number of videos. Zuckerman and his colleagues compared the number of videos they found to the number of guesses it took, and arrived an estimate: in 2022, they calculated that YouTube housed more than nine billion videos. By mid 2024, that number had grown to 14.8 billion videos, a 60% jump. For many, YouTube brings to mind the faces of bright-eyed influencers vying for money and fame, or professional content creators like MrBeast or Joe Rogan. But the researchers then took a subset of the videos and had human reviewers watch each one to answer a series of questions about what they saw. For the most part, they didn't find the work of professionals. Only 0.21% of the videos they analysed featured any kind of monetisation, such as a sponsorship or an advertisement in the video itself. Less than 4% of the videos included a call to action like YouTube's famous invitations to like, comment and subscribe. Those with some kind of set or background design accounted for 14% of videos, while only 38% had undergone any form of editing. More than half of the videos had \"noticeably shaky\" camera work. Only around 18% of videos we're judged to have high quality sound, and the sound quality varied significantly almost 85% of the time. More than 40% had just music, and no speech. About 16% of videos in the sample were primarily still images. The top YouTubers attract audiences in the hundreds of millions, but the researchers estimated the median number of views for a YouTube videos is just 41, and 4% of videos haven't been watched a single time. About 74% of videos have zero comments. Around 89% have no likes. Typical YouTube videos aren't just getting little attention it seems, they're also very short. They assessed that the median YouTube video is only 64 seconds long, and more than a third of videos are less than 33 seconds long. YouTube once sold itself as a tool for regular people. The company's early slogan was \"broadcast yourself\". But today, YouTube suggests it's more of a service for people to watch the work of professional creators. In his annual letter at the start of 2025, YouTube's chief executive Neal Mohan said the company's mission is still to \"give everyone a voice\" – but most of the message was a discussion about how \"YouTubers are becoming the start-ups of Hollywood\" and \"YouTube is the new television\". This narrative misses a critical piece of the picture, says Ryan McGrady, the senior researcher in Zuckerman's lab, who participated in the scraping project. YouTube is a free service that was built from the ground up by a private company, and it could be argued that Google should be able to run the platform as such. But when you examine how people are actually using YouTube, it looks less like TV and more like infrastructure, McGrady says. (To identify languages, the researchers used speech recognition software called Whisper. It paints a fairly accurate picture, but makes occasional errors. For example, Whisper sometimes identifies unintelligible sounds as Nynorsk, a written-only language in Norway.) \"Most of us imagine YouTube as this place where millionaires give away prizes in a Squid-Game-style contest,\" he says. \"But when you want to have a conversation about YouTube and its place in our society, we need to look at the ways it's used, not just the ways it's consumed.\" YouTube is one of the internet's de facto repositories, the first place many of us go when we have videos we want to post or store online. It's also a place where local authority meetings are broadcast, for example, providing a vital opportunity for public accountability in ways that weren't possible before it existed. It isn't just a \"platform\", McGrady says, it's a critical piece of infrastructure, and that's how it should be regulated. \"For companies that own so much of our public sphere, there are some minimum expectations we should have about transparency.\" Google is dealing with more regulatory pressure than ever before. The company has faced multiple cases across the globe accusing it of running illegal monopolies in several industries. Google has lost several of them, and is currently fighting a number of other antitrust lawsuits. More like this: • The ghosts of India's TikTok • Google just updated its algorithm. The internet will never be the same • The riddles humans can solve but computers can't But YouTube has escaped much of the scrutiny that's challenged its biggest social media competitors, according to Barrett of New York University. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk make frequent, loud pronouncements about how they do business and what's happening on their platforms. \"Google, in contrast, has largely stayed out of the crossfire by choosing a strategy of being much quieter, a strategy I'd say has largely worked for them,\" he says. \"Social media is an anomaly when it comes to how little companies need to explain themselves if you compare it to other industries like finance, or agriculture or even broadcasting,\" Barrett says. \"But social media companies are fundamental players not just in mass communication but in all matters of political and civic life.\" The most important thing to understand is the inner workings of YouTube's algorithm, a system that has astronomical power over the distribution of information all over the world, Barrett says. But simple details about what happens on the platform are important as well. \"It would be very valuable to know all of the facts that are currently so shrouded and unavailable. They are the building blocks of doing deeper research,\" he says. \"It only takes you so far, but you've got to start someplace. The more basic information we have to assess, the healthier the public debate about the role of social media in society will be.\" * Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

        "content": "Some women are concerned about how contraceptive pills could be affecting their mental health. Are these fears backed up by evidence? Like many young women, Sarah E Hill spent her late teens and most of her twenties on the contraceptive pill. \"I never thought twice about it,\" says Hill, now a researcher who teaches evolutionary psychology at Texas Christian University, an institution affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in the United States. It was only when she switched contraceptives, 12 years after starting to take the pill, that an epiphany dawned on her. \"My life felt brighter and more interesting, like I had walked out of a 2D black-and-white movie into a full-colour, 3D, meaning-filled reality,\" says Hill. Her experiences of taking oral contraceptives inspired her to study the science involved and publish a book, How the Pill Changes Everything, in 2019. In recent years, many women have become concerned about the pill's side effects, particularly on their moods and mental health. In fact, there has been a growing backlash – one which is most evident on social media where hashtags like #quittingbirthcontrol have drummed up millions of views. This is thought to partly explain why the pill has been suffering a popularity crisis of late. Prescription figures are falling in many developed countries: England's Sexual and Reproductive Health services reported that the uptake of oral contraceptives had fallen from 39% in 2020-2021 to 27% in 2021-2022. Meanwhile, American pill-users dropped from 31% in 2002 to 24% between 2017 and 2019, while Canada and Australia reported pill use tailing off from 23% to 11% from 2006-2016 and 2008-2016, respectively. In addition to discussing legitimate concerns, social media influencers have been spreading misinformation about the contraceptive pill's side effects, both mental and physical. While they may have no medical background, some are even encouraging women to abandon contraception altogether – a trend which some experts believe could be behind a recent spike in abortions in the UK. But can the pill really alter one's personality and outlook on life? Can it contribute to serious mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, or even lead to suicide, in extreme cases? The answer, it appears, isn't clear-cut. When the pill made its debut in the US in 1960, it amassed a whopping 1.2 million users within two years. The tiny beige tablets marked a revolutionary new birth control, hailed by women as a symbol of sexual liberation and female empowerment, freeing them from fear that an unwanted pregnancy would derail their careers or degrees. Today, oral contraceptives are the go-to choice for some 150 million women around the world, or roughly 16% of the global contraceptive-taking population, with a failure rate of only 1% (or 9% when you factor in human error such as forgetting the occasional dose). The failure rate of a contraceptive is defined as the number of unintended pregnancies that would occur if 100 women used that method for a year. There are two types of contraceptive pill, and both are made up of artificial sex hormones. First, there's the most popular kind, the combined pill, which contains synthetic versions of oestrogen and progesterone. The other is the progestogen-only pill, or \"mini-pill\". Both work to prevent pregnancy in a handful of ways, including suppressing ovulation and thickening the cervical mucus to make it harder for a sperm to penetrate and reach an egg. However, the hormones in oral contraceptives don't just affect the body, they can also have powerful effects on women's brains. \"The impact of hormones on the brain is complicated,\" says Johannes Bitzer, an obstetrician-gynaecologist (OBGYN) and psychotherapist at the University Hospital Basel in Switzerland. \"For some individuals, the pill has a positive effect on mental well-being. In others, it may cause irritation and even anxiety.\" Medical warnings, for the most part of the pill's 65-year history, have been scant. Some sexual health providers in the UK and the US make no mention whatsoever of the mental side effects of the pill on their websites. \"I think the big issue is that in OBGYN training, mental health is not a subject. It's for the psychiatrists,\" says Bitzer, who has been in the field for nearly 40 years. Things are slowly changing, but \"before, when we discussed the pill, we talked about thrombosis, cancer, irregular bleeding, weight gain, and so on. The issue of mental health was more or less excluded,\" he says. There hadn't been much investigation into potential mental side effects from researchers, either. But a shift started taking place in 2016, says Bitzer, when a group from Denmark published a seminal paper on the topic, leading to more research in the years after. In the original Danish study, researchers dug into the country's national health database to track the mental health of over a million women aged between 15 and 34 over a period of 14 years. They discovered that women who started taking the combined pill were 70% more likely to be prescribed antidepressants six months later, as compared to those who had never taken oral contraceptives. For those starting on the mini-pill, the risk was 80%. In 2023, a separate group of researchers gleaned similar results when they analysed the health records of a quarter of a million women in the UK Biobank, a large repository of genetic and medical information. Pill-users, they found, were 71% more likely to be depressed compared with never-users, two years after beginning their contraceptive. \"There's a convincing temporal association between starting use of these products and then developing depression symptoms,\" says Øjvind Lidegaard, a medical epidemiologist specialising in obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Copenhagen, who led the Danish study. However, both of these studies were \"cohort studies\", conducted by analysing the data of large groups of women, and comparing the mental health outcomes of those who were taking oral contraceptives with those who weren’t. This means they were able to identify if there was an association between these two things, but not unravel whether there was cause and effect. There could, for example, be some pre-existing differences between the groups of women that affect the results. Some studies seem to contradict the correlation between certain mental health conditions and oral contraceptive use. For instance, when researchers at Ohio State University reviewed 26 earlier studies, they found only a \"minimal\" link between progestogen-only methods of contraception and depression. Separately, in two clinical trials, each involving between 200 and 340 women in Sweden, researchers concluded that the combined pill didn't lead to depression or worsening mood. Intriguingly, taking a \"break\" from oral contraceptives – as is required for seven days each month with many types of the combined pill – can lead to mood worsening, according to some findings. In a 2023 study involving 120 pill-taking women in Austria, some of whom were long-term users, participants reported feeling a 7% increase in anxiety during their pill pause, as well as a 13% and 24% rise in negative feelings and mental health symptoms, respectively. \"So from a mental health perspective, it might be more beneficial for contraceptive users to go for continuous use,\" says Belinda Pletzer, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Salzburg, who is leading an EU-funded project to study the effect of hormonal contraceptives on the female brain. Pletzer doesn't discount the fact that some women do suffer poorly, psychologically speaking, when on the pill, and that these symptoms should be taken seriously. \"But it's just a small percentage of women,\" she says. One reason to explain the vast discrepancy in study findings on the mental side-effects of oral contraceptives is quite simply the nature of what's at hand, says Helena Kopp Kallner, an OBGYN at Danderyd Hospital near Stockholm in Sweden. Namely, that mental health conditions are often measured subjectively, and are notoriously difficult to study. Add to that that there are many different pill types (over 30 brands of the combined pill exist), so often scientists might end up comparing apples to oranges, she says. The different studies also use varying methodologies, she says. What researchers look for at the end of their study also affects their findings, adds Bitzer. In the Danish study, for instance, \"the fact that you get prescribed antidepressants is not necessarily related to a diagnosis of depression, but to the practice of the doctor, which makes your outcome measure quite problematic\", he says. It's also hard to prove cause-and-effect relationships from such observational studies, says Sofia Zettermark, a physician based in Gothenburg, Sweden, because there could be other factors – such as genetics and one's environment – that may influence the results. For example, when she analysed the health records of nearly a million women in the national Swedish registries, she discovered that women from low-income and immigrant backgrounds were more sensitive to experiencing mood changes on hormonal contraception. Lidegaard, for his part, clarifies that his study must be understood in the wider context. \"There's no doubt that some women who start using hormonal contraception experience severe changes in their mental health,\" says Lidegaard. \"However, it's important to realise that it's only 7 to 8% who face so many mental incidences that they are forced to stop taking their medication...The majority of women taking these products don't feel any severe discomfort mentally.\" And of course, for some women the benefits of oral contraceptives may outweigh any side-effects. In addition to providing highly effective contraception, the combined and mini-pill can have other positive physical effects. \"If you have endometriosis, heavy bleeding, or PMDD [premenstrual dysphoric disorder, an extreme and debilitating form of PMS], then the pill can actually help improve it,\" says Kopp Kallner. Pregnancy itself can also involve significant health complications, particularly in the developing world. Meanwhile, several studies have found a link between unplanned pregnancy and a higher risk of depression. But where there are impacts on mental health, how exactly does this happen? There are many ways that oral contraceptives might be able to interfere with women's moods. One side-effect of the contraceptive pill is that it affects the production of natural oestrogen and progesterone, hormones which have potent roles in the brain including cognition as well as neuroprotective effects, modulating blood flow, inflammation, and signalling. Instead, combined and mini-pills, as well as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), contain synthetic versions of these hormones which disrupt the natural progression of the menstrual cycle. This includes progestins, a group of artificial progestogen hormones that can be manufactured in a variety of ways, though the majority are made from testosterone. Neither synthetic oestrogens or progestins are chemically identical to the hormones naturally produced by the body. This is thought to have a number of consequences. One is that, in women who are taking the contraceptive pill, pathways involving the neurotransmitter serotonin – which is often described as the brain's natural \"mood-booster\" – might be disrupted. In one study, a group of Danish researchers analysed brain scans of 53 healthy women, 16 of which were taking oral contraceptive pills, to assess the activity of the serotonin system. They found that the women using oral contraceptives had 9-12% lower levels of a certain type of serotonin signalling compared to the women who were not taking these drugs. The effect was twice as large as the impact that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are known to have on this particular kind of signalling. The researchers speculated that this might be the mechanism responsible for the link between oral contraceptives and depression. There's also some evidence that the artificial oestrogen and progestins present in oral contraceptives might interfere with the production of allopregnanolone, another hormone with crucial roles in the brain – particularly the regulation of mood and the body's stress response. A pharmaceutical version of this hormone was approved in the US in 2019 for the treatment of post-natal depression. In women who are not taking artificial sex hormones, progesterone can be converted into allopregnanolone. But in women using the contraceptive pill, this process is thought to be disrupted: progestins don't get broken down into allopregnanolone, meaning they may miss out on some of its anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects. In one study conducted in rats, those taking oral contraceptives had lower concentrations of allopregnanolone in the brain. In another study in rats, this reduction was found to be linked to a reduction in social behaviour and sexual motivation – side effects which the authors speculated might be relevant to women taking oral contraceptives. However, the results of animal studies do not always translate into humans. Making matters worse, the pill can mess up a woman's stress response, possibly leading to anxiety and depression. \"What researchers have found is that you get a blunting of the cortisol response to stress that most naturally cycling women experience,\" explains Hill. \"No cortisol equals no stress, which might sound like a good thing on the surface. But that's not how it works – cortisol isn't what causes stress, it's how our body helps cope with and recover from stress.\" There's one group in particular that Lidegaard worries about: teenage girls. His study revealed that those aged between 15 and 19 were almost twice as likely (1.8 times) to receive an antidepressant prescription after starting the combined pill compared to those who did not take the pill. For those on the mini-pill, the risk was more than double (this group was 2.2 times more likely to be prescribed antidepressants than those who did not take the pill). Similarly, Zettermark's study found that adolescent girls displayed the strongest association between hormonal contraceptives and antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication use. Those aged 12 to 14 were 240% and 190% more likely to be prescribed the drugs within a year of starting the combined pill and mini-pill, respectively; or 52% and 83% if they were between 15 and 17 years old. In another study, based on the data from 264,557 women invovled with the UK Biobank, researchers found that those who had taken oral contraceptives at some point in their lives had a higher risk of developing depression over their lifetime, but the risk was most pronounced during the first two years of use. Apart from adolescents, there's another group many physicians are wary of prescribing oral contraception to. \"If you have been depressed previously, have recurrent depressions, or any psychiatric issues at all, you have an increased risk of feeling depressed on the pill,\" cautions Kopp Kallner. Experts such as Kopp Kallner say self-awareness is key – you should monitor your mood for a few months when you first start the pill, or switch from one brand to another. If you have concerns about how your contraception is affecting your mood, arrange to speak to your healthcare provider. With so many different types of progestins, and combinations of these with artificial oestrogen, not to mention the different doses and preparations, finding the right fit is \"a little bit of an art,\" says Bitzer. \"It's very much individualised treatment.\" However, there are many other types of contraception available that either do not involve hormones or contain lower doses than oral contraceptives, including male and female condoms (which can also help protect against sexually transmitted diseases), the vaginal ring, the IUS (the hormonal coil), the IUD (the copper coil), and sterilisation. For Hill, changing the method of contraception she used was life-altering. \"Take the time to find a mode of pregnancy protection that makes you feel like the person you want to be,\" she advises. \"With time, patience, and self-compassion, you will be able to find something that works for you.\" * All information in this article is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of a doctor or other health care professional.

        "content": "An aeronautical company in the US has released footage showing a concept version of its flying car performing a vertical take-off before flying over an SUV. Jim Dukhovny, the CEO of Alef Aeronautics, told the BBC's senior technology reporter Chris Vallance, that he had thousands of pre-orders and hoped to start production within 12 months. For around $300,000 (£237,000) the company says buyers will get an electric flying car with a predicted airborne range of 110km (68 miles). But taking a friend for a spin may prove tricky - the cockpit only has enough room for one and a half people. As Vallance points out, Alef Aeronautics are not the only ones trying to make flying cars take off with buyers. There are also huge technological and regulatory hurdles to overcome, so there's still a long way to go before science fiction becomes reality.

        "summary": "The incident happened during a public event where the K-pop star hugged 1,000 fans.",
        "content": "A Japanese woman who unexpectedly kissed K-pop boy band BTS's Jin at a fan event last year has found herself under investigation by South Korean police. South Korean police have called for the woman - who is currently in Japan - to come forward for questioning on charges of sexual harrassment in a public space. The incident happened during the K-pop idol's first public event in Seoul last June  which saw him hug 1,000 fans. Instead of just hugging the star, the woman appeared to have kissed his face, with Jin responding by turning his face away. The kiss angered other BTS fans, one of whom filed a criminal complaint against her, leading police to launch an investigation. On 13 June, 2024, the day after he was discharged from the army, Jin, whose real name is Kim Seok-jin, held a fan event where he hugged 1,000 fans and performed songs in front of 3,000 others. During the three-hour long \"hugathon\", fans who won the chance to embrace him queued up and went on stage one by one to meet the 33-year-old star. But one of them caused an uproar when she appeared to kiss Jin's face. Clips of the moment went viral on the internet. Videos show that Jin, taken aback by the move, tried to turn his head while hugging the woman before quickly moving on to the next fan. Fans could also be seen reacting angrily to her actions. She later wrote on her blog later that she kissed him \"on his neck\" and \"the skin was very soft\". The woman's identity has not been revealed but police added that they had identified her with the assistance from their Japanese counterparts. The BBC has reached out to BTS' agency HYBE for comment. Jin is the first BTS member to have been discharged from military duty. He was followed by J-Hope who was discharged in October. The other four - V, RM, Jimin, Jungkook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025. K-pop idols are known for having a close relationship with their fanbases through various communication channels and events. It's common for artists to communicate with fans through social media livestream chats and in-person events to cultivate loyal fans. But fans and agencies have increasingly been aware of some toxic fan cultures as well. For example, many artists have been vocal about the stress caused by \"sasaeng fans\", who are overly obsessed with their idols that would stalk and harass the artists. The reports of a new deployment come after Pyongyang was said to be suffering heavy losses in the Kursk region. The downfall of Masahiro Nakai is a marked departure from how Japan treats claims of sexual violence.

        "author": "Shaimaa Khalil",
        "published_date": "3 hours ago",
        "summary": "Shiori became the face of Japan's MeToo movement after she accused a prominent journalist of rape.",
        "content": "When Japanese journalist Shiori Ito decided to speak up about her rape allegations, she knew she was standing in the face of a society that preferred silence. \"I'm scared…but all I want to do is to talk about the truth\", Shiori says in the opening scene of her Oscar-nominated documentary Black Box Diaries. Shiori became the face of Japan's MeToo movement after she accused a prominent journalist Noriyuki Yamaguchi of rape. Her acclaimed directorial debut, based on her memoir of the same name, is a retelling of her quest for justice after authorities found the evidence insufficient to pursue criminal charges. But there is one country where it is yet to play: Japan, where it has run into huge controversy. Her former lawyers have accused her of including audio and video footage she did not have permission to use, which, they say, has violated trust and put her sources at risk. Shiori defends what she did as necessary for \"public good\". It's a startling turn in a story that gripped Japan when it first broke -the then 28-year-old Shiori ignored her family's request to remain silent. And after her public accusation did not result in a criminal case, she filed a civil lawsuit against Yamaguchi and won $30,000 (£22,917) in damages. Shiori told the BBC making the film involved \"reliving her trauma\": \"It took me four years [to make the film] because emotionally I was struggling.\" She was an intern at Reuters news agency in 2015, when she says Yamaguchi invited her to discuss a job opportunity. He was the Washington bureau chief for a major Japanese media firm, Tokyo Broadcasting System. Shiori claims she was raped following a dinner in Tokyo with Yamaguchi, who has always denied the allegations. CCTV footage of an intoxicated Shiori being dragged from a taxi and into a hotel is part of the more than 400 hours of footage she edited for the documentary. The editing process, she says, was \"really challenging. It was like hardcore exposure therapy.\" When the film was released, the CCTV footage became a source of friction as Shiori's team of ex-lawyers, who helped her win her  lawsuit, slammed the documentary. They claimed it was unauthorised use of CCTV footage - and that she had violated a pledge not to use it outside of court proceedings. . Last week, her former lawyers – led by Yoko Nishihiro - held another press conference, saying her use of the footage posed challenges for  other sexual assault cases. \"If the fact that the evidence from the trial has been made public is known, we will be unable to obtain cooperation in future cases,\" Ms Nishihiro said. Ms Nishihiro claimed that Shiori had also used unauthorised recordings, saying she only found this out at a screening of the film last July. This included audio of a police detective who eventually acted as a whistleblower about the investigation process – as well as a video of a taxi driver who provided testimony about the night of the alleged rape. Both of them, the lawyers argued, were identifiable and neither had given their consent to be featured in the film. \"I've been trying so hard to protect her for eight-and-half years, and I feel like I've been completely torn apart,\"  Ms Nishihiro said. \"I want her to explain and be held accountable.\" Shiori had earlier acknowledged that she did not have the hotel's permission to use the CCTV but argued that this was \"the only visual evidence\" she had of the night she was sexually assaulted. She added that including audio of the police detective was necessary because of \"the cover up of the investigation\", adding that she was releasing the video \"for the public good\". \"We are standing in different points of view,\" she said of the fallout with her former lawyers. \"For me, [it's for the] public good. For them, it's 'do not break any rules'.\" There has been no official explanation as to why the film has not yet been distributed. Shiori has said that \"Japan is still not ready to talk about [it]\", but its unclear how much of it is also due to legal hurdles. In her latest statement last week, Shiori apologised and said she would re-edit parts of the documentary to make sure individuals would not be identified, adding that a redacted version would be screened moving forward. \"There are moments I wish I didn't have to put in [the documentary]. There are moments I'm not proud of but I wanted to put all of it and to show we are also human,\" she told the BBC. \"No-one is perfect.\" In the nine years since the assault, Shiori's fight against Japan's justice system has been well-chronicled in the media - and is something she says she wanted to detail in her documentary. She was met with a wave of backlash when she went public in 2017, receiving hate mail and online abuse. \"People were telling me you're not crying enough… you're not wearing proper clothes... you're too strong.\" Some criticised the way she was dressed at the press conference where she first accused Yamaguchi  – they said her shirt had been buttoned too low down. Shiori said she left Japan for a few months, fearing for her safety. Shiori's case was followed by other high-profile cases. In 2023, former soldier Rina Gonoi also went public with her story, accusing three ex-soldiers of sexually assaulting her. This was the year Japan passed landmark laws to redefine rape from \"forcible sexual intercourse\" to \"non-consensual sexual intercourse\" and raised the age of consent from 13 to 16. Gonoi eventually won her case but Shiori says it is proof that speaking up against sexual violence comes at a price, adding: \"Is it worth going through this as a survivor seeking justice? It shouldn't be this way. You have to sacrifice a lot.\" For now it's unclear if her  film will ever be screened in Japan, but she says that its homecoming would be her ultimate prize. \"This is my love letter to Japan. I really wish one day I can screen my film, and my family can also watch it,\" she added. \"That's what I really hope for… more than winning an Oscar.\" Éanna Hardwicke tells BBC he is \"not a fan of rehashing things\", though he can why some want to revisit the characters. The actress's career has enjoyed a recent resurgence thanks to a role in the film The Last Showgirl. As the Oscars race starts to take shape, here's the ABC (Anora, The Brutalist, Conclave) of films to watch. The much-celebrated actor's filmography includes Oscar-nominated dramas to comedic roles. Lauren Patel says she thought she \"dreamt it\" when her agent said she had been invited to Hollywood. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "content": "Pop star Katy Perry will blast off into space as part of an upcoming all-women flight on Blue Origin's New Shepherd rocket. The Firework singer will be joined by Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos's fiancee Lauren Sanchez, CBS presenter Gayle King, former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn. Blue Origin said this is the first all-women space flight to take place since the Soviet Union's Valentina Tereshkova's solo mission in 1963. There is no specific date for the launch, but Blue Origin said it would take place this spring. Katy Perry is scheduled to be on her Lifetimes Tour from 23 April until 11 November, so this trip is expected to take place before that. \"If you had told me I'd be part of the first all-female crew in space, I would have believed you. Nothing was beyond my imagination as a child,\" Perry said in a statement cited by Newsweek. The NS-31 mission will be the 11th human spaceflight for the New Shepherd rocket and the 31st in its history. So far, the programme has launched 52 people into space. A trip on the New Shepard typically lasts about 11 minutes, according to Blue Origin. It is fully autonomous - which means there are no pilots - and takes the passengers past the Karman line, internationally recognised as the edge of space. Blue Origin credited Lauren Sanchez for bringing the mission together, saying in its press release that she is \"honored to lead a team of explorers on a mission that will challenge their perspectives of Earth, empower them to share their own stories, and create lasting impact that will inspire generations to come\". Sanchez first announced her plan to fly with an all-women crew on a Blue Origin rocket in 2023 in an interview with Vogue, saying they were \"paving the way for women\". This is the latest group of celebrities to embark on a flight to space. Bezos himself flew on the company's first manned mission in 2021. Good Morning America's co-host Michael Strahan and Star Trek actor William Shatner have also been blasted into space on one of Bezos's rockets. Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Galactic, made a trip aboard his company's VSS Unity spacecraft in July 2021. SpaceX founder Elon Musk, however, is yet to make a trip. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing. The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials. The US leader plays down earlier frictions and predicts a \"very good meeting\" on Friday. \"What a beautiful accent,\" the US president said of the British leader.

He had a wide-ranging career spanning more than six decades, winning two Academy Awards - for his work on The French Connection and Unforgiven - two Baftas, four Golden Globes and a Screen Actors Guild Award.

        "published_date": "6 hours ago",
        "summary": "Authorities say there was no sign the couple had sustained any injuries, but no cause of death has been given.",
        "content": "Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife appeared to have been dead for \"quite a while\" when the couple and their dog were found on Wednesday afternoon at their home in the US state of New Mexico, police say. Hackman, 95, was discovered in a side room near the kitchen of the house in Santa Fe, while his wife Betsy Arakawa, a 65-year-old classical pianist, was found in a bathroom. Authorities reported no signs of injury but deemed the deaths \"suspicious enough\" to investigate and have not ruled out foul play. No cause of death was given. In a wide-ranging career, Hackman won two Academy Awards for The French Connection and Unforgiven. Three of Hackman's children from a previous marriage confirmed the death of their father and Ms Arakawa in a statement to the BBC. \"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa. We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss,\" Elizabeth, Leslie and Annie Hackman said. Warning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting The Santa Fe County Sheriff's office confirmed the deaths. \"On 26 February, 2025, at approximately 1:45pm, Santa Fe County Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to an address on Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park where Gene Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa, and a dog were found deceased,\" the office said. In a news conference on Thursday afternoon, Sheriff Adan Mendoza said: \"It sounds like they had been deceased for quite a while, and I don't want to guess in reference to how long that was.\" He added: \"There was no immediate sign of foul play. Haven't ruled that out yet. \"This is an investigation, so we're keeping everything on the table.\" A sheriff's detective who responded to the scene said that they believed the couple had been dead for some time because of Ms Arakawa's \"decomposition\" and \"mummification\" in the hands and feet. \"The male decedent also showed obvious signs of death, similar and consistent with the female decedent,\" said the search warrant. Near Ms Arakawa's head was a portable heater, which the detective determined could have been brought down in the event that she abruptly fell to the ground. Authorities say they have requested carbon monoxide and toxicology tests for both Hackman and his wife, and that a cause of death has not yet been determined as they await the results of the autopsy. A prescription bottle and scattered pills were on the bathroom countertop close to her body. The couple's German Shepherd dog was found dead in a bathroom closet near to Ms Arakawa. Hackman was discovered wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a blue long-sleeve T-shirt and brown slippers. Sunglasses and a walking cane were next to the body. The detective suspected that the actor had fallen suddenly. The circumstances of their death were \"suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation\", said the search warrant, because the person who called emergency services found the front door of the property open. But the detective observed no sign of forced entry into the home. Nothing appeared out of place inside. Neither was there any indication that belongings had been rummaged through, or that any items had been removed. Two other, healthy dogs were discovered roaming the property - one inside and one outside. The couple's 2,300 sq ft ranch-style home, part of a gated community, was valued at around $1m, according to tax records. The local utility responded and found no sign of a gas leak in the area. The fire department detected no indication of a carbon monoxide leak or poisoning, according to the search warrant. The detective spoke at the scene to two maintenance workers, one of whom had called the emergency services. The two workers said they sometimes conducted routine work at property, but rarely ever saw the couple. They indicated that they communicated with them by phone and text, primarily with Ms Arakawa. The two workers said they last had contact with the couple two weeks beforehand. A recording of the 911 call obtained by the BBC shows the emotional caller telling a dispatcher how he found the two bodies. \"No, they're not moving,\" he says in the audio. \"Just send somebody out here really quick.\" The person, who made the call while standing outside the property and peering in through a window, is heard saying \"damn\" repeatedly. Hackman met Ms Arakawa when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, the New York Times has previously reported. He won the best actor Oscar for his role as Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in William Friedkin's 1971 thriller The French Connection, and another for best supporting actor for playing Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven in 1992. A relative latecomer to Hollywood, Hackman's breathrough came in his thirties, when he was nominated for an Oscar for portraying Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde - opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway - and again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970. Both films saw him recognised in the supporting actor category. He was also nominated for best leading actor in 1988 for playing the FBI agent in Mississippi Burning. He played more than 100 roles during his career, including supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s. Hackman featured opposite many other Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow and Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein. His last big-screen appearance came as Monroe Cole in Welcome to Mooseport in 2004, after which he stepped back from Hollywood for a quieter life in New Mexico. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "author": "Noor Nanji",
        "published_date": "8 hours ago",
        "summary": "The actress's career has enjoyed a recent resurgence thanks to a role in the film The Last Showgirl.",
        "content": "Pamela Anderson has had her fair share of ups and down over her career. So that might explain why she's so stoic about missing out on an Oscar nomination for her role in The Last Showgirl. “The win is the work,” the Canadian actress told BBC News. “You couldn't have told me I'd be here a decade ago, so this is very exciting for me, to even be in the conversation.” Anderson, 57, did manage to score nominations at the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards for her part in Gia Coppola’s film about a fading Las Vegas dancer. But she is not in the running for the Academy Awards, which take place this Sunday in Los Angeles. “I just wish everybody well,” she said. “I think anybody, any actor, realises that all of this is about having another chance to be able to perform and share your talent with the world.” Anderson rose to prominence on the 1990s TV series Baywatch. The lifeguard drama became the most-watched television show in the world at the time, and it's still the role she's best known for. But in the three decades since she first ran along the California beaches, fans and critics have become acquainted with different parts of Anderson's life story including Playboy covers, a leaked sex tape and many marriages. In 2022, Hulu series Pam & Tommy told the story of how Anderson and now ex-husband Tommy Lee's sex tape was stolen and illegally distributed in the mid-90s. Anderson later criticised the series in an interview with Variety, describing it as \"shocking\" and calling for the people behind it to apologise to her. Now, she's starring in a new film which is also about second chances. In The Last Showgirl, the lead character Shelly, played by Anderson, must plan for her future after her show abruptly closes. Plenty of critics have drawn parallels with Anderson’s own life in the spotlight, and she doesn't dispute this. “I think that’s what drew me to the project, that it was so relatable on so many levels,” Anderson said of the film. She added that its central theme, of struggling to make your career work as a woman in later middle age, was something \"many generations of women\" had faced. In the film, Shelly is portrayed as having a strained relationship with her daughter Hannah. Shelly's career as a showgirl means she often works late, causing her to miss important moments like bedtime with Hannah. That, too, is something that Anderson says she can relate to. She shares two sons, Brandon Thomas, 28, and Dylan Jagger, 27, with her ex-husband, Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee. She said that for all working mums, there's \"no proper way\" to be a parent while also following your dreams and pursuing your career. “So this movie is, I think, in a very vulnerable space. “And it was an interesting role to play with all her imperfections and selfishness and selflessness. And it was a lot of layers and nuances to the character that I could really relate to.” The Last Showgirl has received a mixed reception from critics, though most have praised Anderson's performance. The New York Times called it \"sensitive and beguiling\" and described Anderson as \"dazzling\". But the Guardian awarded it just one star, calling it \"a big disappointment\" (although a later review bumped that up to three stars). Many have also described the role as Anderson's \"comeback\". She doesn't reject the term, but says she prefers to see it as \"a new chapter\". \"I've always been fascinated with the craft of acting,\" she said. \"[But] my personal life kind of took me off course, and I raised two beautiful boys.\" She's not the only actress to be back in the spotlight this season. Demi Moore is nominated for best actress at the Oscars for her role in The Substance, a body horror which has revitalised her career. \"I'm really happy for Demi,\" Anderson said. \"I think she's earned her place. And you have to earn it. You have to fight for it.\" With so many strong female protagonists in this year's films, I'm curious what Anderson now thinks of Baywatch. The show has long been criticised for its portrayal of its female characters, who, many argued, were sexualised and denied meaningful plot lines. \"I didn't see it like that at all. I thought it was quite innocent and wholesome and, and fun to watch,\" she said. \"I always felt like I was surrounded by such incredible people, lifeguards that were also firemen or firewomen. It was really, really, empowering.\" Anderson has always been seen to embody a look that rose to prominence in the 90s - skinny, blonde, and enhanced by plastic surgery. But in recent years, she has been sporting a \"no-makeup\" look, choosing instead to embrace her natural appearance. \"My beauty routine is rest. And so that's more important to me these days,\" she told me. She said it's not that she's against makeup, but more that she thinks \"there's a time and a place\" for it. \"This chapter, for me, has been about self-acceptance and finding out who I am. What are my original thoughts? What do I have to give?\" she said. \"I know I have a lot more to give in this world, in this industry too, and I feel like even I have to remember who I am to start with and then hopefully, play characters in films and not in my personal life.\" Shiori became the face of Japan's MeToo movement after she accused a prominent journalist of rape. Authorities say there was no sign the couple had sustained any injuries, but no cause of death has been given. Morgan Freeman describes the actor as \"incredibly gifted\" while Clint Eastwood said he was \"extremely saddened\" by the news.

        "summary": "The documentary was pulled last week after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
        "content": "The BBC has apologised and admitted \"serious flaws\" in the making of a documentary about children's lives in Gaza. The documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from iPlayer last week after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official. It said it has \"no plans to broadcast the programme again in its current form or return it to iPlayer\". Hoyo Films, the production company that made the documentary for the BBC, said it felt it was \"important to hear from voices that haven't been represented onscreen throughout the war with dignity and respect\". The company added it was \"cooperating fully\" with the BBC to \"help understand where mistakes have been made\". The BBC removed the documentary after concerns were raised that it centred on a boy called Abdullah who is the son of Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture. Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and others. It also launched a review into the film, and the BBC's Board met earlier on Thursday to discuss it. In the statement, a BBC spokesperson said both the production company and the BBC had made \"unacceptable\" flaws and that it \"takes full responsibility for these and the impact that these have had on the corporation's reputation\". It added the BBC had not been informed of the teenager's family connection in advance by the film's production company. The spokesperson says: \"During the production process, the independent production company was asked in writing a number of times by the BBC about any potential connections he and his family might have with Hamas. \"Since transmission, they have acknowledged that they knew that the boy's father was a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas government; they have also acknowledged that they never told the BBC this fact. \"It was then the BBC's own failing that we did not uncover that fact and the documentary was aired.\" Hoyo Films have told the corporation that they paid the young boy's mother \"a limited sum of money\" for narrating the film via his sister's bank account, the BBC statement added. It said Hoyo assured the BBC that no payments were made to any members of Hamas or its affiliates \"either directly, in kind or as a gift\", and that it is seeking \"additional assurance\" around the programme's budget. In its statement, Hoyo added: \"We feel this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors – who have no say in the war – should have their voices heard\". A full audit of the expenditure on the film will be undertaken by the BBC, and it will be asking for the relevant financial accounts of Hoyo Films so this can be carried out. The BBC spokesperson said the incident had \"damaged\" the trust in the Corporation's journalism - and \"the processes and execution of this programme fell short of our expectations\". They added the director-general of the BBC had asked for complaints to be expedited to the Executive Complaints Unit, \"which is separate from BBC News\". A separate statement from the BBC Board added: \"The subject matter of the documentary was clearly a legitimate area to explore, but nothing is more important than trust and transparency in our journalism. While the Board appreciates that mistakes can be made, the mistakes here are significant and damaging to the BBC.\" Prime Minister Keir Starmer was asked about the film during a press conference with US President Donald Trump on Thursday, saying he had been \"concerned\" about it, adding that \"the secretary of state has had a meeting with the BBC\". Earlier this week, the BBC was criticised for pulling the programme by more than 500 media figures, including Gary Lineker, Anita Rani and Riz Ahmed. Copyright 2025 BBC.

Hackman was found dead along with his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog at his home in New Mexico, US. No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was \"suspicious enough\" to merit investigation. In a statement, daughters Elizabeth and Leslie, and granddaughter Annie said: \"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just dad and grandpa.\" Morgan Freeman who co-starred with Hackman in the 1992 movie Unforgiven - for which Hackman won an Oscar - described the actor as \"incredibly gifted\" while the movie's director Clint Eastwood said he was \"extremely saddened\" by the news. Ralph Fiennes - nominated for an Oscar this year for Conclave - paid tribute to the late actor with a black and white portrait of a smiling Hackman, simply titled Gene Hackman 1930-2025. Viola Davis called Hackman \"one of the greats\" while Tom Hanks posted on Instagram that: \"There has never been a 'Gene Hackman Type.' There has only been Gene Hackman.\" The Prince of Wales also issued a statement saying he was \"so sad to hear the news\". \"Hackman was a true genius of film who brought each and every character to life with power, authenticity and star quality,\" added Prince William, who is also president of Bafta. Hackman's 1978 Superman co-star Valerie Perrine labelled him \"a genius\", while the Guardian's film critic said his death \"marks the end\" of the era of American new wave cinema. The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, who worked with Hackman on the 1974 mystery thriller The Conversation, called Hackman \"a great artist\". In a statement posted on Instagram, Coppola said: \"Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity. \"I mourn his loss, and celebrate his existence and contribution.\" Hackman, who won two Oscars for his work on The French Connection and Clint Eastwood's Western Unforgiven, played more than 100 roles across his career. They included supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s. Perrine, who acted opposite Hackman as his character's on-screen girlfriend Eve Teschmacher, described the late actor as \"a genius\" and one of the \"greatest to grace the silver screen\". She posted on X: \"His performances are legendary. His talent will be missed. Goodbye my sweet Lex Till we meet again.\" Hackman appeared alongside Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow, Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein and Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton in 1981's Reds. He also starred in the hit movies Runaway Jury and Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums. The British Academy of Film and Television, said it was \"saddened\" to hear of Hackman's death, describing him as a \"much-celebrated\" actor with an \"illustrious\" career. Spanish actor Antonio Banderas described it as being \"a very sad day for the cinema's family\". Hank Azaria, the actor best known for voicing characters in The Simpsons, said \"it was an honour and an education working with Gene Hackman\" on 1996's The Birdcage. \"Mike Nichols said of his genius character acting: 'He always brought just enough of a different part of the real gene to each role he played.'

Star Trek actor George Takei posted: \"We have lost one of the true giants of the screen. \"Gene Hackman could play anyone, and you could feel a whole life behind it,\" he wrote. \"He could be everyone and no-one, a towering presence or an everyday Joe. That's how powerful an actor he was. He will be missed, but his work will live on forever.\" Slumdog Millionaire star Anil Kapoor also called Hackman a \"genius\" performer. \"A true legend whose legacy will live on,\" he wrote. As well as his Oscar wins, Hackman also collected two Baftas, four Golden Globes and a Screen Actors Guild Award. The Guardian's film critic Pete Bradshaw wrote that Hackman's death \"marks the end of one of the greatest periods of US cinema: the American new wave.\" \"Hackman was the gold standard for this era, ever since Warren Beatty gave him his big break with the role of Buck Barrow in Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967),\" said Bradshaw. \"He was the character actor who was really a star; in fact the star of every scene he was in – that tough, wised-up, intelligent but unhandsome face perpetually on the verge of coolly unconcerned derision, or creased in a heartbreakingly fatherly, pained smile.\" Adding: \"He wasn't gorgeous like [Robert] Redford or dangerously sexy like [Jack] Nicholson, or even puckish like [Dustin] Hoffman; Hackman was normal, but his normality was steroidally supercharged.\" The critic branded his performance \"as the reckless, racist cop\", 'Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle, in William Friedkin's 1971 film The French Connection as \"unmissable\".

        "summary": "The show paid tribute to the \"great\" quizzer, who also won Mastermind and Brain of Britain.",
        "content": "Quizzer Chris Hughes, star of the popular BBC and Channel 5 series Eggheads, has died aged 77, a statement on the programme's social media accounts has said. Hughes was one of several general knowledge experts who regularly appeared on the show, which saw members of the public take on the five so-called \"Eggheads\". A statement posted on the show's Facebook and X accounts on Thursday, reported by the Press Association news agency, paid tribute to an \"Eggheads great\". \"It is with immense sadness that we announce the passing of Eggheads great Chris Hughes,\" it read. \"Chris joined the show in 2003 and over the next 20 years gave us not only brilliant answers but very many laughs and happy memories.\" It concluded: \"He will be hugely missed by all his Eggheads family.\" Hughes was born in Middlesex and attended Enfield Grammar School. Before becoming known as one of the country's leading quizzers, he worked as a train driver and railway worker. He went on to become a regular contributor on Eggheads - which began on BBC Two in 2003 before moving to Channel 5 in 2020. The Eggheads panel was made up of general knowledge experts, including winners from others shows such as Mastermind, The Weakest Link and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?. In each episode, five Eggheads would compete with a team made up of five members of the public, who would play individually against a single Egghead in each round, before a final face-off between the remaining players of both sides. If the amateurs were successful, they would take home a cash prize. The jackpot would increase by £1,000 per episode, with each edition's prize money rolling into the next day if the Eggheads won. As a result of the Eggheads high level of expertise, many of the jackpots would reach a sizeable sum before finally being won. The highest ever jackpot reached £75,000, which was won by a team in 2007. The series was presented by news presenter Dermot Murnaghan, before Radio 2 DJ and Channel 5 talk show host Jeremy Vine took over the role. Hughes is one of only seven people to have won both Brain of Britain and Mastermind, and also scored a victory on International Mastermind. Eggheads producer Robert Dean said on X: \"[Hughes] was an amazing Egghead who considered everyone on the production team part of his family. \"I have such fond memories of him and count myself lucky to have known him. I'll miss him tremendously.\" After having reached the final of another hit quiz show, The Weakest Link, without getting a single question wrong, host Anne Robinson declared Hughes to be \"the best contestant we have had on the Weakest Link\" and chose not to use her mean spirited signature catchphrase: \"you are the Weakest Link, goodbye!\".

        "author": "Christopher Luu",

        "summary": "In the new series of Influential, actress Brooke Shields tells Katty Kay about becoming famous aged 11 months and taking control of her life and career on her own terms.",
        "content": "In the new series of Influential with Katty Kay, actress and model Brooke Shields opens up about spending nearly six decades in the spotlight and how she finally overcame her imposter syndrome. More than 40 years after Time magazine called her the face of a decade in a 1981 cover story, actress and model Brooke Shields says that she's finally confident enough to not feel like a failure. Speaking to the BBC's Katty Kay for her interview series Influential, Shields opens up about everything from landing an Ivory soap campaign as an infant to the fallout from that infamous Time photo shoot. In 2023, a Hulu documentary, Pretty Baby: Brooke Shields, offered a glimpse into the reality behind the tabloid headlines, centering on the relationship between Shields and her late mother, Teri. With a new book released on 14 January, Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old: Thoughts on Ageing as a Woman, Shields comes into her own and embraces the difficult task of ageing in the public eye. Having been working since she was an infant (on the aforementioned soap ad), Shields says her public association with youthful beauty - those iconic eyebrows and big hair - has made the ageing process even more of a challenge. \"[Having] a youthful face, just regularly getting older is almost viewed as a disappointment,\" she tells Kay. \"I think, psychologically, it's a very interesting thing… You really have to do a lot of work on yourself internally to be OK with not also being disappointed with yourself.\" Shields had early success as a model (she posed for Calvin Klein and Richard Avedon aged 15) and then as an actress, when she starred in films like The Blue Lagoon (1980) and Endless Love (1981). \"I was the original influencer, actually,\" she jokes. Since then, she has parlayed her fame into partnerships with skincare brands, launched her own haircare line, Commence, and an online platform for women over 40, Beginning is Now. It's that community that she's embracing with her new book, with the realisation that some are starting to see her as a 59-year-old, not just the girl who starred in Pretty Baby. Being so strongly associated with a decade hasn't helped shift public perception, even though she has worked consistently since then. \"It was a shock to me the first time I saw a wrinkle on a monitor, because I thought something was in the film,\" she says, revealing that she sometimes mistakenly believed she was immune to the passage of time. \"I knew that I had to find value beyond the surface and looks and beauty, because it was such a part of my upbringing and who I was to people.\" Shields acknowledges that she's spent much of her life keeping up appearances, but she's had the privilege to see that Hollywood's focus on eternal youth isn't necessarily a universally held belief around the world. \"It's definitely a very American thing. I think you go to Europe – I'm not sure about the UK as much, but definitely in Italy and France – there is a certain respect and reverence for beauty, mature beauty,\" she says. \"We don't – we have not figured that out yet. I think, I hope it's changing a bit. I'm hoping to contribute to that.\" Where to find Influential with Katty Kay Watch Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on YouTube. She calls ageing liberating, not limiting. While Hollywood has been more welcoming of women of a certain age – just look at Demi Moore, Martha Stewart and Jennifer Coolidge's recent renaissances – Shields explains that there's a selfishness that arrives when things like children and career pressures aren't on the agenda anymore. \"I think that there's a freedom to it and there's so many different factors that when you delve into them, you understand why this is a prime of our life in a way that is focused on just us,\" she says. \"Not our biological clock, not societal pressures, not all of these things that we operate by – because your time runs out.\" Shields's career since the 90s has been marked by focused diversification; exploring ways to find success away from her appearance. Her CV includes a Broadway stint in shows like Chicago, Cabaret and Grease, in addition to her TV and film work. She has published two children's books and written about postpartum depression. She is also mother to two daughters, Grier and Rowan, and earned a degree in romance languages and literatures from Princeton University. \"When you start to write books or take jobs in other mediums and you learn different skills, [like] Broadway, speaking, all of those things that sort of add to you as a human being, the onus on just looking a certain way or on [being] 'the face of a decade', which is ridiculous in and of itself,\" she says. \"I was a pretty face but you know, really?\" More like this: • Entrepreneur Jane Wurwand on why 'high-touch will overshadow high-tech' in business • Ina Garten on her internet appeal: 'Young people don't have mom in the kitchen' • Olympic legend Lindsey Vonn explains the mindset of a winner Shields says this self-reflection is what allowed her to finally feel able to rub shoulders with her peers. She tells Kay that during an event for the opening of Sunset Boulevard with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, she realised that she could hold her own. The imposter syndrome that had loomed over her years in the spotlight had evaporated. \"Everything that I've done and been and seen and grown from and learned gives me the opportunity to not be intimidated by any of these people in these rooms. I can admire them and I can look up to them and love their talent,\" Shields says. \"I can be good enough. I'm as good as [whomever] I used to hold up on a pedestal.\" Influential with Katty Kay airs on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "author": "Nicholas Barber",
        "published_date": "24 January 2025",
        "summary": "The contenders for the film industry's biggest prizes this year represent a range of genres and styles – but there's a common thread that's hard to miss.",
        "content": "The contenders for the film industry's biggest prizes this year represent a range of genres and styles. But many are united by a common thread: they take on contentious topics with ferocious energy. A fabulous range of films has been nominated for Academy Awards this year, from a shiny Broadway musical to a fact-based South American drama, from a rollicking farce about a stripper to an impressionistic period piece set in a Florida reform school. From a distance, it might appear as if the Academy's voters had covered just about every genre and mood that cinema has to offer. But when you look closer, it's remarkable how many of the nominees have something in common. In their own distinctive ways, these films take on contemporary issues with enough ferocious energy to make this one of the most political selections in the history of the Oscars. In the case of The Apprentice, the political aspect is inescapable. Ali Abbasi's film is a controversial biopic of newly inaugurated president Donald Trump, concentrating on his years as an aspiring real-estate mogul in New York. In October, Trump denounced the film as a \"cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job\". The Academy seems to have liked the film: The Apprentice received two acting nominations, one for Sebastian Stan, who plays Trump himself, and one for Jeremy Strong, who co-stars as his mentor, Roy Cohn. Other nominees aren't so blatantly political – indeed, many of them are excellent precisely because they approach politics from unexpected angles – but they're hardly timid in making points which could provoke some viewers. The film with the most Oscar nominations this year is Emilia Pérez, a French musical directed by Jacques Audiard. Its 13 nominations include best picture, best director and best adapted screenplay while its star, Karla Sofía Gascón, is the first trans woman to be nominated for the best actress Oscar, which is quite a statement in a week when Trump signed an order declaring that there are only two sexes recognised in the United States and that that they cannot be changed. What's more, its stand-out song and dance number, the Oscar-nominated El Mal, is an angry condemnation of corrupt politicians and other grandees. I'm Still Here has done startlingly well, too. Walter Salles' Brazilian drama has been nominated not just in the best international picture category, which most commentators expected, but in the main best picture category. And its star, Fernanda Torres, has been nominated for best actress. These accolades will give a huge publicity boost to a film which is a thoughtful treatise on the importance of being strong-willed and tireless in the face of a totalitarian regime. In its own more brightly coloured and crowd-pleasing fashion, Wicked has similar themes. Nominated in ten different categories, including best picture, best actress, best supporting actress and best original score, it's a film which seems at first to be a lesson in treating less privileged people kindly. But like the film it's a prequel to, The Wizard of Oz, it has provocative things to say about the nature of power in its depiction of the Wizard as a self-serving ruler who uses fear and deceit to control the population. And so it goes on. Brady Corbet's The Brutalist, which also garnered ten nominations, including best picture, best director and best actor, is about a Hungarian-Jewish architect struggling to establish himself in the US after World War Two, and Sean Baker's Anora, which has six nominations, including best picture, best director and best actress, is about a sex worker in today's New York. But both of them shine a piercing spotlight on the immigrant experience and the entitlement of the super-rich. RaMell Ross's Nickel Boys, adapted from Colson Whitehead's novel, and recognised for best picture and best adapted screenplay, doesn't feel like a standard period drama, thanks to its bold use of first-person perspective, but its subject is the US's racist past – and how that past reverberates into the present day. Greg Kwedar's Sing Sing, which has nods for star Colman Domingo and adapted screenplay, too, tells the true story of a theatre group for incarcerated men. It doesn't mention racism at all, but almost all of its characters are black and working class, which says a lot about the reality of US prisons: data published by the Pew Research Center in 2020 showed that at the end of 2018, there were 2,272 prison inmates per 100,000 black men, compared to 392 inmates per 100,000 white men. Even Dune: Part 2 – nominated for five awards, including best picture – is knottier on the subjects of religion and leadership than the average science-fiction blockbuster. In most years, one or two overtly political films are nominated for Oscars, such as anti-capitalist satire Triangle of Sadness  in 2023 and in 2024, Martin Scorsese's dark reckoning with the exploitation of Native Americans, Killers of the Flower Moon. In 2025, such films are the rule rather than the exception. More like this: • Why Emilia Pérez is causing upset in Mexico • Wicked author Gregory Maguire on its real meaning • The blistering drama exploring the US's racist past The question now is whether these political nominations will translate into a political awards ceremony. Traditionally, Oscar acceptance speeches shy away from anything more contentious than asking for more diversity on film sets, as Frances McDormand did when she accepted her best actress award for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri in 2018. And when Oscar winners do allude to US politics, they can get a mixed reception, as Michael Moore did when he criticised George W Bush during his acceptance speech for Bowling for Columbine, the 2003 winner of the best documentary prize. But this year feels as if it could be different. The most thrilling part of March’s ceremony might not be seeing who wins, but hearing what they say when they do. --  If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "headline": "'You're playing with one of our biggest wars': Why some Mexican people are upset about Oscars frontrunner Emilia Pérez",
        "author": "Emma Jones",
        "published_date": "22 January 2025",
        "summary": "Musical Emilia Pérez, about a Mexican drug lord, is the frontrunner for the Academy Awards, with 13 nominations. But its depiction of the country is stoking criticism.",
        "content": "French director Jacques Audiard's musical about a Mexican drug lord is the frontrunner for this year's Academy Awards, with 13 nominations. But its depiction of the country is stoking criticism. Rarely is a film so successful with critics and awards voters, yet so controversial to its detractors. Emilia Pérez, written and directed by French auteur Jacques Audiard, won both the Cannes Film Festival jury prize and a joint best actress prize for its four leads back in May. More recently, the Spanish language musical, set in Mexico but mostly filmed in France, has won four Golden Globes, five European Film Awards and been nominated for eleven Baftas. It's now the frontrunner at this year's Oscars, having received 13 nominations in today's announcement, more than any other film. The genre-mixing story of a male Mexican drug lord who transitions into a woman seeking restorative justice for the country's \"disappeared\" – dead and missing persons who have been the victim of drug and crime-related violence – has also made history with a nod for actor lead actress Karla Sofía Gascón. She is the first trans woman to be nominated for best actress. But while the film's characterisation of its transgender protagonist has been divisive – the US LGBTQ+ organisation Glaad has called it \"retrograde\" – it isn't even currently the most controversial talking point. That would be Emilia Pérez's representation of Mexico, which has come under increasing scrutiny as awards season has kicked into gear. The film is due to open in Mexico to the general public tomorrow, but there have already been complaints from Mexican critics and industry figures about the negligible involvement of Mexican people among its leading cast and crew; and its depiction of the country, not least when it comes to dealing with such a horrifying subject. Following Emilia Pérez's Golden Globes success, there was a flurry of criticism of the film on X from Mexican users. In one post that's been viewed 2.6 million times, Mexican screenwriter Héctor Guillén tagged the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who run the Oscars, the day after the  Globes and published a poster saying: \"Mexico hates Emilia Pérez/ \"Racist Euro Centrist Mockery\"/ Almost 500K dead and France decides to do a musical.\" \"I tried to copy the Hollywood way of promoting films [for awards consideration], you know, when they basically say, 'amazing film'\" Guillén tells the BBC. \"I wanted to do a counterpart of that, I wanted to get another vision out of what Emilia Pérez is to many of us Mexicans.\" Awards Watch Emilia Pérez has been nominated for 13 Academy Awards, making it the most recognised film at the 2025 ceremony. Karla Sofía Gascón and Zoe Saldaña earned acting nominations and the film is also up for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score and has two entries in Best Song: El Mal and Mi Camino. Saldaña won the Golden Globe award for Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role in any Motion Picture and El Mal won for Best Original Song. Emilia Pérez is also nominated for 11 awards at the Baftas. Click here for more on the films getting awards buzz. Guillén calls Audiard \"a great film-maker\" but says the decision to make the vast majority of the movie in studios outside Paris, as well as the way the story treats a painful national topic has upset many in his social network. \"There's a drug war, nearly 500,000 deaths [since 2006] and 100,000 missing in the country,\" he says, citing recent Mexican government figures.\"We are still immersed in the violence in some areas. You are taking one of the most difficult topics in the country, but it's not only any film, it's an opera. It's a musical. So for us and many activists, it's like you are playing with one of the biggest wars in the country since the Revolution [in the early 20th Century]. Part of the plot is about searching mothers of the disappeared [searching for their children]: one of the most vulnerable groups in Mexico. And there were zero words in the four Golden Globe acceptance speeches to the victims.\" Guillén also questions why a decision wasn't made to involve more Mexican people in the production. One of the four leading actresses, Adriana Paz, is Mexican. Of the others, Zoe Saldaña, who won a best supporting actress Golden Globe, has Dominican heritage but was born in the US; Karla Sofía Gascón is Spanish, from a Madrid suburb, though she has worked extensively in Mexican TV; and the last (and most famous), Selena Gomez, is American, but with Mexican heritage. Having grown up speaking Spanish but lost her fluency, Gomez had to re-learn the language for the role, while her character Jessi was rewritten to make her character Mexican-American rather than purely Mexican. Meanwhile Saldaña's character, Rita, a lawyer, was changed to reflect Saldaña's Dominican, rather than Mexican, background. As for Audiard, he is not a Spanish speaker at all. \"Their way of making the film is to disregard so many in the (film) industry in Mexico already talking about this topic, like not considering Mexican screenwriters, or more Mexican actors other than Adriana, who did an amazing job,\" Guillén argues. He cites as \"really painful\" the film's Mexico-born casting director Carla Hool's comment during a Sag-Aftra Foundation Q and A that they had searched Latin America and Mexico for actors, but ultimately, they believed that they had chosen the best ones for the job. \"Having a few Mexicans in there does not stop it from being a Eurocentric production,\" he adds. There could be commercial reasons behind the casting decisions: Gomez and Saldaña are arguably bigger global names for the project than many Mexican actors. In particular, Gomez's performance led to another viral moment of criticism against the film, this time on a popular Mexican film podcast, Hablando de Cine. More like this: • The secret to making a Hollywood comeback • The shock Globes wins that changed the Oscars race • 25 films to look forward to in 2025 Actor Eugenio Derbez told host Gaby Meza that Gomez's Spanish pronunciation was \"indefensible\" leading to Selena Gomez to comment on a TikTok post of the podcast clip: \"I'm sorry, I did the best I could with the time I was given\". Derbez later apologised for the remark, while Meza says that the wider interview between her and Debrez was not a criticism of Gomez's acting in the film – indeed, Gomez was nominated for a Golden Globe and a Bafta – or her Spanish accent, given she was supposed to be playing an American for whom Spanish is not her first language. \"It was intended to remark that if you don't speak Spanish, you just see her good performance with subtitles,\" Meza explains. \"And she does give a good performance. What isn't good is that there's a disconnect between the words she says and her understanding of them. Her body, her voice, her tones say something, but the dialogue doesn't match with what she's saying. And that's not Selena's fault, because I think she wasn't given the proper indications, the tools for her performance. The director is French and Selena is from the United States, but they're communicating in Spanish.\" Meza adds that in her opinion, the movie is one that's \"designed for export\". \"If you go to resorts in Mexico, tourists can buy things that look Mexican, but they're made elsewhere,\" she says. \"With this movie, you might see references to Mexican culture, and it might speak about Mexico, but it wasn't made in Mexico.\" However, amid the flurry of criticism, some accusations about the film are inaccurate. For example, one post on X called the director \"a Frenchman who'd never set foot in Mexico\". Audiard, however, tells the BBC that he went to Mexico several times, looking to shoot the film there, as well as cast the main roles. \"I had the idea of making an opera of Emilia Pérez and then I got a bit scared, I felt like I needed to inject some realism into it,\" he says. \"So I went to Mexico, and we scouted there during the casting process as well, maybe two, three times and something wasn't working. And I realised that the images I had in my mind of what [the film] would look like just didn't match the reality of the streets of Mexico. It was just too pedestrian, too real. I had a much more stylised vision in my mind. So that's when we brought it to Paris and reinjected the DNA of an opera within it.\" \"And also,\" he adds, \"it might be a little bit pretentious of me, but did Shakespeare need to go all the way to Verona to write a story about that place?\" Judging by the film's success in awards season, many critics and voters must agree with Audiard, or at least, believe Emilia Pérez has strong artistic merit regardless of this issue. \"I felt it was hugely fresh as a piece of work when I saw it,\" James Mottram, a British film critic, says. \"I mean, a brand-new take on the cartel story, a very unusual musical, a transgender story. Just combining those three elements is a feat of narrative dexterity. I admire the bravery of the film more than anything. Audiard has worked in the crime genre before – if you could call this a crime film – with movies like The Beat That My Heart Skipped, but this felt brand new. And as a critic, that's what you're always looking for – someone who's taking on divisive subjects and putting a fresh spin on them. \"You can call Emilia Pérez a soap opera as well as an opera, and it is a fantasy on some level, I don't think it is supposed to be an authentic portrayal of the cartels. However, it's difficult, I can understand why some Mexicans are offended when it's such a sensitive subject for them, and not that many were involved in the production. \"There's been complaints from the trans community about it as well. Audiard's been attacked from all angles really, and perhaps understandably, but I think when you do something risky and divisive, that's always going to happen.\" Jacques Audiard says that he first had the idea for the film after reading some of French author Boris Razon's novel Écoute, which featured in one chapter the minor character of a drug lord \"who wanted to transition\" but \"Boris hadn't followed up on the idea\", as Audiard puts it. \"There are two sensitive issues really in this film, transgender identity and the disappeared in Mexico,\" he says. \"And it's something that I can't quite rationally explain, but there was a link between the two where I imagined that this story of whether this gangster, who's responsible for this evil, redeems themselves and by extension the whole of Mexico, through this transition, through changing themselves. \"And I think that the use of opera, of singing, and of dancing, allows a certain distance and by which it makes the message much more effective. It penetrates much more deeply than if than you were to document it in a very realistic manner.\" Nevertheless, in a recent press conference in Mexico, Audiard apologised to his critics, saying that the film is opera, and thus not \"realistic\" and that \"if there are things that seem shocking in Emilia Pérez then I am really sorry… Cinema doesn't provide answers, it only asks questions. But maybe the questions in Emilia Pérez are incorrect\". Yet, while there is some anger, the film also has high profile supporters in Mexico, including The Shape of Water director Guillermo Del Toro, who called Audiard \"one of the most amazing film-makers alive\" in an on-stage conversation with the director at a Directors Guild of America screening last October, and True Detective: Night Country director and writer Issa Lopez, who has declared the film a \"masterpiece\". Meanwhile Paz has said of the controversy: \"I've heard people saying it's offensive to Mexico. I really want to know why, because I didn't feel that way.  And I have questioned some people that I trust, not just as artists but as people, and they don't feel that way, so I am trying to understand.\" Saldaña tells the BBC that letting film-makers carry out their artistic vision is important, even when the topic is delicate. \"I think that we're living through really sensitive times where communities are very vocal about being represented accurately,\" she says. \"And I vacillate with respecting that, which is primarily my goal, but also allowing space for gentle film-makers or storytellers to have a very special approach to it and giving space for them to do it even if they're not a part of that community. Because sometimes they may have the best story to tell. And I think that Jacques was always respectful, was always very gentle, with how he was approaching it.\" Saldaña, who was grateful that the film gave her an opportunity to work in her native Spanish language (\"I've never been able to do it before, apart from an independent film in the Dominican Republic when I was very young, but never in the US,\") also says that she \"wasn't worried\" about Audiard not speaking Spanish, as he had made films including A Prophet and 2015's Palme d'Or winner Dheepan in other languages besides French. \"He's challenged himself and defied this gravity that we hold ourselves to through language, and it hasn't prohibited himself from connecting with other people. I've always admired him for being curious about other cultures and for telling stories without appropriating himself,\" she says. But Emilia Pérez is now part of the current cultural debate about whether cultural authenticity is of paramount importance in storytelling, or if western productions should be more aware that they're open to accusations of cultural appropriation when directors are dealing with stories in countries and cultures outside their realm of experience. Asked how he feels should the film be further rewarded by the Oscars, Héctor Guillén replies that, \"it just shows the industry works that way, that it's distant from what's happening in Latin America and Mexico, even if we're not that far away from California. The screenwriter says he \"just wishes\" the production had been \"more open\" to advice from within Mexico. \"I think Audiard is a great film-maker, and I think he was well intentioned with the film, I do not think he's a racist French man who wants to ridicule our culture,\" he says. \"But he could have been more open to Mexican creators, to activists, to talk about the correct way to tell the story. Because I did think at the end of the film, there was an opportunity to be a great, great, audacious film in the right way.\" Emilia Pérez is available to stream on Netflix internationally -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "A new revival of Christopher Marlowe's pioneering play about the 14th-Century King of England puts the spotlight back on his relationship with his male \"favourite\" Piers Gaveston. This week, at its base in Stratford-upon Avon, the world-famous Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is opening a new production of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II. Though this influential 16th-Century play about a beleaguered queer monarch is more than 430 years old, it still feels stingingly relevant. Marlowe depicted a king whose authority and ability to rule is fatally undermined by his relationship with another man. Modern-day UK monarchs hold only ceremonial power, but overt queerness in the British royal family remains vanishingly rare. Lord Ivar Mountbatten, a second cousin of King Charles III who is currently competing on US reality show The Traitors, is widely described as \"the first openly gay royal\". Marlowe's play dramatises the struggles of Edward II, a real-life King of England who reigned from 1307 to 1327. A year after Edward II succeeded his father, Edward I, he married the King of France's daughter, Isabella, in an effort to strengthen Anglo-French relations. Queen Isabella bore Edward II four children, and became a formidable figure in her own right – she is sometimes called \"the she-wolf of France\". But Marlowe's play really hinges on the king's controversial relationship with his male \"favourite\", Piers Gaveston, and how this sparked a constitutional crisis that he never recovered from. The playwright never says outright that the two men are lovers, but the queer subtext is hardly subtle. In one scene, after he is reunited with his favourite, Edward beseeches him to \"kiss not my hand [but] embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee\". In another, Isabella bemoans the fact \"the king regards me not, but [instead] dotes upon the love of Gaveston\". Only a wilfully obtuse reader of Marlowe's text could miss the insinuation that these two men are more than just friends. Ever since it was written, Marlowe's play has helped to cement the real-life Edward's debatable but not entirely misleading reputation as a \"gay king\". To put it simply, we can never know for certain whether Edward II had a romantic and/or sexual relationship with any of his male favourites. But when it was first performed in 1592, it paved the way for the monarch's queerness to be openly discussed by historians. \"The earliest text we have accusing Edward of some kind of sexual transgression was written around the time Gaveston was murdered [in 1312],\" historian Kit Heyam, author of The Reputation of Edward II, 1305-1697, tells the BBC. \"It says that at the beginning of Edward's reign, there was 'much lechery habitually practised'.\" In the parlance of the time, \"lechery\" was used to describe any kind of \"sinful\" sexual behaviour, according to the mores of the Catholic Church, which held religious authority in England at the time. \"The text seems to be suggesting that this behaviour will stop now that Gaveston's dead, but it stops short of saying that the sexual transgression was actually between Gaveston and the king,\" Heyam says. In the centuries after Edward II's death, it became less risky for writers to insinuate that Edward II may have been sexually transgressive, but the invention of the printing press in the 15th Century cranked up the innuendo. \"Writers would sensationalise their texts to make them more commercially appealing, so they started saying that Edward II was definitely sexually transgressive, and it was definitely the fault of his male favourites,\" Heyam says. \"But Marlowe was the first person to join the dots, and say that Edward II was actually sleeping with them.\" The actor and RSC co-artistic director Daniel Evans, who portrays Edward II in the new production, believes that Marlowe's play still feels \"radical\" in 2025. His interest in reviving it was piqued by director Daniel Raggett, who posed a \"provocative\", hypothetical question that underlines the piece's enduring relevance: \"What would happen if our current king, Charles III, suddenly said: 'I know I've been married for a while, but I actually want someone called Colin by my side, not Camilla?'\" It might not cause a civil war, as Edward's relationship with Gaveston begets in Marlowe's play, but Evans questions just how accepting today's \"supposedly liberal and permissive society\" would be. \"Deep-rooted homophobia still exists, and the whole notion of the British Royal Family, of lineage and heirs, is very dependent on a heteronormative family structure,\" he notes. Evans and Raggett were also intrigued by the play's late-20th-Century renaissance, which is inextricably linked with the burgeoning LGBTQ+ rights movement. Dr Will Tosh, head of research at Shakespeare's Globe, and author of Straight Acting: The Many Queer Lives of William Shakespeare, says that Marlowe's play \"doesn't have a hugely long performance history\" outside of the era in which it was written. He notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, it essentially went \"into cold storage\" because the idea of a male monarch having a male lover would have been anathema to conservative Georgian and Victorian audiences. The play's subsequent revival in the second half of the 20th Century coincides with a \"more curious and less judgmental attitude to queer intimacy\", Tosh says. In 1969, two years after male homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales, but 11 years before the same advance was made in Scotland, Ian McKellen portrayed Edward II in a Prospect Theatre Company production that toured the UK. Gaveston was played by James Laurenson, a New Zealand actor who died last year, and their on-stage kiss caused some controversy when the production arrived in Edinburgh. \"The late councillor John Kidd took offence to this show of male affection, particularly as it took place on a stage erected within the assembly hall of the Church of Scotland,\" McKellen recalls on his website. Though a couple of local policemen were sent to watch the production, McKellen notes that they found \"no problem\" with its contents and this brief fuss \"guaranteed full houses for the run.\" When this production was broadcast on the BBC a year later, it made history by including the first same-sex kiss ever shown on British television. In a 2017 interview, McKellen said that the Prospect production also had a profound impact on \"many, many Americans\" who watched it on US network PBS. \"They saw for the first time in their lives two men kissing and couldn't believe it, but took comfort from it,\" he said. The play's place in the queer canon was further cemented by a 1991 film adaptation directed by artist and gay rights activist Derek Jarman. Featuring a deliberately anachronistic mix of modern and medieval props, costumes and backdrops, Jarman's film dials up Marlowe's homoeroticism, and reframes the story within the context of the contemporary LGBTQ+ rights movement. As Gaveston (played by Andrew Tiernan) is tortured for his transgressions, Jarman shows police clashing with protesters from gay-rights group OutRage!. More like this: • \"He was a monster\": How history got Henry VIII wrong • The redemption of America's most vilified First Lady • The historic female gang who menaced London A year before Jarman's film, Marlowe's play was staged by the RSC with Simon Russell Beale in the title role. Angela K Ahlgren argues in her 2011 essay Performing Queer Edward II in the 1990s that Jarman's film and this RSC revival of the play \"reflect notions of queerness circulating in the 1990s because they stage violence, same-sex desire, and references to contemporary gay political issues\". At the time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the gay male population globally, and queer activists in the UK were protesting against Section 28, a piece of legislation that prohibited the supposed \"promotion of homosexuality\" by schools and local councils. It had been enacted by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government in 1988, following a rising tide of anti-gay sentiment in the media. Still, Marlowe's play should never be regarded as a work of historical gospel. Tosh says the playwright's \"major dramatic innovation\" is to make the king's relationship with Gaveston the \"central drama\" of his life by \"compressing the timeline\". In reality, Edward II cultivated relationships with other highly influential male favourites after Gaveston was murdered in 1312, just five years into his 19-year-reign. But Marlowe depicts his bond with Gaveston as by far the most emotionally significant. \"After Gaveston's death in the play, Edward invokes his memory to justify whatever he's doing. And later, when Edward is imprisoned and mistreated, he invokes Gaveston's name again as a plea for salvation,\" Tosh says. Of course, Marlowe's play also invites us to make serious presumptions about the nature of the two men's relationship. Historian Kathryn Warner, author of Edward II: The Unconventional King, says we can never know for certain how Edward II felt about Gaveston and his other male favourites because the king didn't keep a diary or write personal letters. \"All we have is the word of outsiders, which is obviously open to interpretation,\" she says. But in all likelihood, given that he fathered an illegitimate child with an unknown woman, Edward II's sexuality was probably more complicated than his reputation as a \"gay king\" might suggest. \"I think in purely physical terms, we could probably call him more bisexual than gay,\" Warner says. \"But emotionally, it strikes me that he probably was gay, because he was very, very close to his male favourites.\" This closeness almost certainly caused his downfall. According to Heyam, Edward's fundamental error throughout his reign was to grant his favourites too much power. \"He failed to realise that being king of England in the 14th Century is very much a manager's job,\" they say. \"Edward needed to keep a number of powerful nobles happy, but when he gave Gaveston power over them, he made them very angry.\" After Gaveston was murdered by a group of rival barons in 1312, Edward II made the same mistake again with Hugh Despenser the Younger, whom Warner describes as \"the last and most powerful\" of his male favourites. It's worth noting that Despenser does appear in Marlowe's play, but only as a relatively minor character called Spencer who is essentially a stand-in for Gaveston following his death. The real-life Despenser had much more agency. In 1324, amid growing tensions with France, he began to wield his influence against Queen Isabella because of her French heritage. Isabella fought back with support from her own favourite, Richard Mortimer, which ultimately led to Despenser's execution in 1325, and Edward II's forced abdication the following year. \"If he had just kept his public and private lives separate, he would probably have been fine,\" Heyam says. In Marlowe's play, the fallen monarch is killed at Mortimer's behest by a red hot poker through his anus. Warner says the idea that Edward II was murdered in this way is \"almost certainly a myth\" – one Marlowe didn't invent, but definitely helped to \"popularise\". Over 430 years later, it remains a shocking image with crassly homophobic overtones. But even if Marlowe's poker scene is apocryphal, the play still has a lot to say about the consequences of intolerance. When Edward complains about being forced to \"leave my Gaveston\", the disapproving Earl of Lancaster replies derisively: \"Diablo, what passions call you these?\" His use of the Spanish word for \"devil\" is surely no accident. \"I hope audiences who see this play think deeply about what happens when you try to ban love and sublimate someone's natural way of being,\" Evans says. \"The endless cycle of violence that this can create is something we can all learn from today.\" Edward II is at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until April 5, rsc.org.uk -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

        "author": "Emma Jones",
        "published_date": "2 days ago",
        "summary": "After the star's surprise SAG win, viral acceptance speech and attention-grabbing campaign, could he pip Adrien Brody to the post to win the best actor prize?",
        "content": "After the A Complete Unknown star's surprise SAG win, viral acceptance speech and attention-grabbing campaign, could he pip Adrien Brody to the post to win the coveted best actor prize? He turned up to his premiere on an e-bike; crashed his own lookalikes contest; laughed at all the times he failed to win awards on Saturday Night Live; and on Valentine's Day he arrived in Berlin's sub-zero temperatures bare-shouldered, in a powder pink vest. Over the course of a few weeks and months, Academy Award nominee Timothée Chalamet has upended the idea of how awards honourees behave in order to secure votes. Could he still be rewarded with a best actor Oscar on 2 March? It would be a major upset even for this extraordinary awards season if so, as the favourite for the prize, Adrien Brody, who plays a Holocaust survivor in Brady Corbet's The Brutalist, has won the Golden Globe, Bafta and Critics Choice Awards – all traditional harbingers of the Oscar. But then 29-year-old Chalamet took the SAG (Screen Actors Guild) prize for best actor on Sunday for his role playing a young Bob Dylan in James Mangold's biopic A Complete Unknown, accepting the award with an earnest speech that went viral. Until that moment, he was at least winning the award for \"one of the most gonzo best actor campaigns in Oscar history\", as Variety describes it. Apart from the e-bike incident in London and poking fun at his \"loser\" awards face on Saturday Night Live, he chatted with Kendrick Lamar ahead of Lamar's performance at the Superbowl half-time show, and impressed on sports channel ESPN by making accurate college football predictions. (Some were moved to label him \"Lisan al-Gaib\" for this, in reference to the seer-like figure from Dune: Part Two, which along with A Complete Unknown, makes two best picture nominees in which Chalamet stars.) \"What I find most interesting is everyone's reaction to it,\" Variety's Chief Awards Editor, Clayton Davis, tells the BBC about Chalamet's campaign. \"It varies from, 'Oh my god, the guy is an artist and he's our generation's James Dean, our Marlon Brando,' to older people feeling like he's the epitome of Gen Z or TikTok.\" Davis believes that Chalamet's actions (not to mention the baby pink and acid green outfits, plus his celebrity partner Kylie Jenner's discreet support) mean that he is speaking directly to his peer group – and that can only benefit the Academy Awards. \"He's really speaking to Gen Z, and I would say, if anything, maybe he's going to be a great and needed lifeline to get Gen Z into the Oscars again, by consuming content differently,\" he says. \"And the Oscars have been trying to find a way to reach that TikTok generation that's going to care about a 100-year-old organisation.\" What he has also done, Davis argues, is made an awards season campaign authentic for someone of his age. \"He's trying to redefine how it looks for someone like him, and I can appreciate that,\" he says. \"And as someone who likes to call themselves an Oscar historian, I'm used to the traditional. You go in, you kiss babies, shake a lot of people's hands, and you talk about your work. Taking your shirt off on the red carpet is different. And it may be jarring for a lot of people at first, and it may not work this time, but it doesn't mean that it won't work ever. When you're the first to do something, it always looks strange until it becomes the norm. We are in a transitional period in Hollywood across the board. Why wouldn't that also hit the Oscar campaign trail?\" The actor's promotional appearances have impressed some Oscar watchers. A post on entertainment website Lainey Gossip praises Chalamet, describing his \"current Oscar campaign-non-campaign\" as \"one of the best, if not the best, of all time… if he gets it, he's doing to do it not by prescription, not by sucking up to the old people.\" However, in his SAG acceptance speech (which also went viral) Chalamet aligned himself with some of the most revered actors in cinema history, naming Marlon Brando and Daniel Day-Lewis as those he looked up to. \"I know the classiest thing would be to downplay the effort that went into this role and how much this means to me, but the truth is this was five years of my life,\" Chalamet said. \"I'm really in pursuit of greatness,\" he added. \"I know people don't usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats. I'm inspired by the greats. I'm inspired by the greats here tonight… I want to be up there.\" He also called Bob Dylan \"a true American hero\" in the speech, and, a week earlier at the Berlin Film Festival, referred to him as \"the man, the myth, the legend\". \"I love how Timothée Chalamet isn't sugarcoating how badly he wants to win the Oscar during his SAG speech,\" wrote Buzzfeed's Spencer Althouse on X. But the perception that the Oscar demographic is older and thus needs a certain style of wooing is rapidly shifting, Clayton Davis says. \"They also added 4,000 new members in the last decade. And a lot of them are young, they're diverse, they're from different backgrounds,\" he explains. \"The Oscars have changed. The old guard, you're never going to get them on board, although when you respect someone like Bob Dylan and recognise his contribution, that speaks to older Academy voters, and they can in turn respect him [Chalamet] as an artist. \"They already embraced the movie; in that it's nominated for eight Oscars. He introduced Bob Dylan to Gen Z, who probably had never heard of this guy before. So, I think you've got to admire at minimum that he is bridging the generational divide.\" Chalamet may be the youngest ever best actor winner in SAG's three-decade history, but the SAG prize was also Chalamet's first ever major award. He was first Oscar-nominated in 2018 at the age of 22 for Luca Guadagnino's love story Call Me by Your Name, Bafta-nominated in 2019 for Felix Van Groeningen's addiction drama Beautiful Boy, and Golden Globe-nominated last year for Paul King's Wonka. But although his filmography speaks of taste and versatility, there are some reasons why an Oscar win for him is still unlikely this year. \"Voting for the Oscars closed already,\" Davis points out. \"I was most confident that he would win the SAG partly because they tend to be more populist in their choices. What it means for the Oscar race now is harder to discern. Is it a 'too little, too late' mentality? I remember last year when Lily Gladstone won the SAG best actress the day before Oscar voting closed, and after I'd concluded that Emma Stone was going to win the Oscar. We all switched our predictions to Lily, and Emma Stone still ended up winning in the end.\" More like this: • Why horror performances deserve more awards • The Brazilian film that could upset the Oscars • 'Category fraud' is the latest Oscar scandal Nor are the statistics on Chalamet's side. No one who has won just the SAG best actor award has then gone on to win the Oscar. Male actors also tend to win their Academy Awards later in life – in an Oscar statistic probably not lost on either of them, Adrien Brody is still the youngest ever male best actor Oscar winner, for The Pianist in 2002 at the age of 29, the same age as Chalamet is now. (By contrast, the youngest ever best actress winner was aged 21 at the time.) \"I think that it's a barrier of entry for some people in terms of voting for him,\" Davis says. \"Some people feel like, 'We have time, Timmy's here. Timmy's very established.' If anything, at minimum this generation's Leonardo DiCaprio, right?\" he says. \"There is this sense of, 'We don't have to do it now.'\" This may not be comforting to Chalamet, as DiCaprio was aged 41 when he finally got his best actor Oscar, on his fourth attempt, but Davis is prepared to predict that next year Chalamet will have another chance at the Oscar in a film he's starring in and producing: Marty Supreme, directed by Josh Safdie. \"Timmy will be here probably next year… Marty Supreme sounds like it's going to be an amazing movie, even though we know nothing about it. He will probably do back-to-back nominations at minimum. And in a year when he played in the sequel to a sci-fi franchise and played Bob Dylan, that's a pretty killer resume for 2024,\" he says. \"And now in 2025, he's going to be sporting a moustache in a Safdie brother movie. I'm excited to see what he's going to continue to deliver.\" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "The Jane Austen-hits-LA comedy changed fashion, language and cinema. As it turns 30 and a new stage musical version opens, its writer and director discusses why it's so personal to her. Back in 1995, Clueless offered a cheeky update of Jane Austen's Emma in a Los Angeles high school and, without even seeming to try, revolutionised how we dress and talk. Tartan and preppy chic are still huge (note the blazer and mini-skirt wore by Taylor Swift in London last August, or the pop star's yellow-and-black combo at an MTV awards do in September). Meanwhile, \"As if!\", the catchphrase of its heroine Cher, which originated as a piece of Californian slang, has become ubiquitous. Will you be spared the phrase in this article? As if! Because the film is brightly coloured and revolves around teenage girls, some critics at the time undersold the sharpness of its satire, which targets (among other things) white, west coast privilege, the plastic surgery industry, celebrity do-gooding, taboos surrounding menstruation, the cruelly low wages of teachers, and the kind of Nietzsche-reading liberal male who feels compelled to grow a goatee. The popularity of Clueless triggered a rash of insouciantly smart high-school-meets-classic literature movies (including 10 Things I Hate About You, Cruel Intentions, and Easy A, to name but a few). Just as importantly, it started a trend for films and TV shows that focussed on friendships between teenage girls. Thanks not only to the script but also a flawless cast and tip-top soundtrack (so much Radiohead), audiences of all ages found themselves rooting for salty protagonists, Cher, Dionne and Tai, who dominate the proceedings in a way that hadn't been seen before in a mainstream US film. Yes, there's a rom-com element to the plot, but it's the tensions between the girls that generate the most heat. Cher's complex interactions with Dionne and Tai paved the way for Buffy and Willow's textured relationship in the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Also, not to be bitchy, but without Clueless there'd be no Mean Girls. And Olivia Wilde cited it as an inspiration for her riotous directing debut, Booksmart, itself a modern teen movie classic. Yet 70 year-old Amy Heckerling, the film's writer-director, claims she had no idea Clueless would be a hit. \"Nobody is ever sure of that,\" she tells the BBC. \"Well, maybe some people are sure of it. Not me.\" Nor does she know if a new West End musical based on the film, for which she wrote the book, will click with audiences; it is currently running in previews ahead of an opening night in March. What matters, she says, is that she enjoyed working on both projects. She says of the musical, \"It will either work or it won't, but I'm loving doing it.\" As for the film, \"I have to admit, on that shoot I was happier than I've ever been. There were no big prima donnas. It was the closest I've ever come to imagining a movie in my brain and seeing it unfold exactly how I imagined.\" In the last three decades there's also been a three-season Clueless TV show, a book series, and another go at a stage musical, which premiered on Broadway in 2018. Still, it's the original film we keep coming back to and that Heckerling, Zooming from her home in New York, wants to discuss. As in Austen's 1815 novel, the plot revolves around a self-absorbed daddy's girl. Cher (Alicia Silverstone; putty-soft and irresistible) bombs around Beverly Hills with best-friend Dionne (Stacey Dash; poised), obsessed with matchmaking and make-overs. Cher is determined to \"help\" a new girl at school – dishevelled New Yorker Tai (Brittany Murphy; volcanically beguiling) – and proceeds to treat Tai like a toy. That is, until Tai fights back and Cher, her mind blown, realises that Tai is her equal. Which is where Heckerling veers off from Austen (whose heroine is ultimately horrified by her protege's \"notions of self-consequence\"). Here's the truth about Clueless. It's not as good as Emma. It's way better. Heckerling suspects that the film has such a loyal following (and keeps picking up new acolytes) because its \"two princesses\", Cher and Dionne, are so human: \"They rag on each other like real friends do.\" She thinks it's stayed relevant because space is given to characters who \"care about the environment\", including Cher's ex-step-brother, Josh, (played by sexy goofball Paul Rudd) and Cher's Greenpeace-supporting teacher, Miss Geist (a delightfully frazzled but unbowed Twink Caplan). Heckerling says, \"Having those people worry about stuff like that makes the audience relate to them. Well, that's what I've always assumed. I'm not a major activist, but I care about a lot of things.\" Heckerling is also proud of the film's many \"wonderful\" teens, some of them gay – like the closeted, blazingly charismatic Christian (Justin Walker) – others broke and scruffy, like lollygagging stoner Travis (Breckin Meyer). Born in the Bronx, to an often cash-strapped family, the pale and petite Heckerling has never felt like a top dog and happily acknowledges that her status as an outsider bled into Clueless's sly take on class conflict. She says that when she first went to California, to attend the American Film Institute, people made fun of how she talked. \"They'd go, 'Amy, you want some [she adopts a cartoonish New York accent] quawfee?' Their attitude was like, 'You're talking some old-fashioned, lower-class, New York language. What planet are you from?'\" On the one hand, it was wounding. On the other hand, she wanted to find a way to fight back: \"I didn't feel like I wanted to change how I spoke or who I was.\" Amy Heckerling's Five Culture Shifters Franz Kafka  Franz Kafka changed modern literature… OK, maybe Joyce did that, too, but wouldn't you rather read Kafka? It's not even like reading, it's like entering a nightmare with a sense of humour. And I think most adolescents can relate to waking up from troubling dreams to find they've turned into horrible vermin. The Twilight Zone When I was a teenager, everyone smoked pot daily, except me. I was addicted to The Twilight Zone, and pot made me worry the stories could come true. And some have. In Midnight Sun, it's always 120 degrees (49 Celsius) and the oceans dried up. How brilliant was Rod Serling? James Cagney  I first fell in love with Cagney when I was a toddler. He was a ball of energy, like Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck. When I was a teenager and interested in boys, he was my main crush. In film school, I appreciated his acting and I admire how he led his life. A Clockwork Orange and 1984 (the books and films)  I'm combining these because what I love is the language. I don't go a day without saying \"Free me glassies\". The future teen slang in A Clockwork Orange (Anthony Burgess) was stylish and thrilling. George Orwell's creation of \"Newspeak\" was genius. The language of 1984 was deliberately getting smaller because without words, there's no thinking, and therefore, no intelligent resistance. That's when she started keeping a notebook of all the new words used by her fellow students and, in the years that followed, any socio-economic tribes she encountered. She says she was especially interested in the \"very\" words – technically known as adverbs of degree, such as 'totally', 'majorly' and 'way' – \"because those 'very' words really define who you are, where you live and what year it is\". Which, of course, came in super handy for Clueless. Via the film, Heckerling demonstrates her complete mastery of LA lingo. At the same time, she finds a way to do justice to her own clique, aka earthy New Yorkers. Clueless immortalises a whole bunch of characters who use Big Apple vocabulary and/or talk with unapologetically broad New York accents; there's Tai, but also Christian, Cher's dad Mel (Dan Hedaya), and a driving examiner (Ron Orbach). Nor is it a coincidence that we're shown a hilarious clip of a \"Bronx-y\" Tony Curtis, looking most uncomfortable in Spartacus (or, in Cher-speak, \"Sporadicus\"). According to Heckerling, Curtis delivers his lines in the way he does (ie at a snail's pace) because he's trying to appear more \"classy\". It's a tactic she's tried herself. \"When you feel kind of insecure about your accent, you try to talk more slowly, as though that will get the Bronx out of it.\" The subliminal message sent by Clueless: Don't try to hide who you are. Own it. Some fans, however, have long believed Heckerling has herself concealed something very important about the film, namely Cher's Jewish identity. It's hard to ignore Cher's Jewish surname (Horowitz), or the mezuzah (a piece of parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah) on her family's front door. Yet, until now, Heckerling has been keen to shut down theories about Cher's ethnicity, pointing out that Cher's surname was originally meant to be Hamilton, and that Horowitz came from an ad lib by Wallace Shawn (as Cher's teacher). Heckerling is proud of her own Jewish roots, and as well as being in love with the Yiddish language (note Dionne's use of the word kvelling), she believes representation is incredibly important. So why, when it comes to Cher, does Heckerling not want to confirm what seems obvious? Whatever Heckerling's intentions when she was writing the script, the character we see in the film is coded as Jewish. If you know what to look for, it's as plain as, well, that mezuzah. Like someone preparing to put down heavy luggage, Heckerling sighs. \"I didn't want to say Cher was Jewish,\" she explains, because \"when you're Jewish, there's always some group that's going to be mad at you\". Another sigh. \"So you don't want to make a big thing of it.\" Heckerling claims that the most autobiographical scene in Clueless is the one in which Dionne (who, like Cher, has a somewhat kamikaze approach to driving) suddenly finds herself on the freeway and freaks out. Heckerling says that she identifies with the feeling of \"not being a very secure driver and suddenly you're in this situation where cars that are very big are coming right up and honking loudly. You're afraid to change lanes, because your car doesn't have the power to zip in and out and it's very frightening. I would often accidentally find myself on the freeway, just screaming till the exit was there!\" The image of Heckerling in her puny car, screaming her head off, is a comical one, but also feels like an apt metaphor for this film-maker's relationship with Hollywood. Pre-and-post Clueless, she was often made to feel as if she didn't belong in the big league (studios were stingy about budgets; bigwigs tried to bury her projects; she was continually messed around when it came to distribution). Which is crazy. Heckerling is actually responsible for two all-time classic films – her 1982 debut, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, launched the careers of Sean Penn and Jennifer Jason Leigh and successfully tackled taboo topics like teen abortion. On top of that, Heckerling created the massively successful franchise, Look Who's Talking (inspired by her own daughter, Mollie). The good news is that Clueless, an iconic juggernaut if ever there was one, has allowed Heckerling to keep going. Here she is, 30 years later, still holding her ground and her nerve. She has plenty of projects in the pipeline. She and Mollie have written a script for Look Who's Talking 4 and are now waiting for feedback. She's also researching a historical Jewish figure (\"I've made a million notes\"). And she would kill to work with Benedict Cumberbatch. Like her own, dearly departed mother (\"the original Cumberbitch!\"), Heckerling \"worships\" the British actor. \"Whenever I'm feeling crummy I'll put on Sherlock, or the Richard III he did for The Hollow Crown [BBC series of Shakespeare history plays],\" she says. \"I can't stand being in the sun. Or the desert. But if he said, 'Let's do a Lawrence of Arabia remake,' I'd be there.\" Serious money has been pumped into the new West End musical. In London, you can't miss the posters, which show Cher, hands on hips, in her yellow tartan suit. Heckerling is pleased with the show because it \"doesn't feel like a different animal\" to the film. \"Some characters have a little more presence than others but, if you like the film, I think you'll feel the show is telling essentially the same story\". Scottish-singer songwriter KT Tunstall, known for hits like Suddenly I See, did the score, while Glenn Slater came up with the lyrics, and their idea has been to create songs that together sound like a 90s mixtape, aping the sound of era-defining acts from Radiohead to Green Day to NSYNC. Heckerling says that she and Slater spent a lot of time working together. \"Me and Glenn would go through the lyrics, with me telling him what the characters were feeling. I'd sometimes tell him, 'Woah, she wouldn't say this!' and changes were made. But, basically, I was so pleased with what he was doing.\" She's all too aware that theatre is a different medium. \"In films, you get to do close-ups of people, you can get into their brains. In a musical comedy, the characters have to reach the last person in the audience with a song. Hopefully people will like the songs.\" The interview is almost over. So much has changed, Heckerling confides, since she made the 1995 film. She's concerned, these days, about censorship and surveillance, \"I'm worried about how much trouble you can get in to right now. It seems like Big Brother is watching everything you do.\" She calls out, mischievously, \"Hi Big Brother! We're just talking about a silly film!\" Memories of those \"wonderful\" days on the Clueless set spur her on. She says that many of her friends aren't working and \"don't even want to be working\". She tuts with amazement. \"It seems very strange to me. I can't imagine not wanting to…\" She searches for the right word, keen as ever to avoid sounding presumptuous or highfalutin. She says, \"I will always want to be creating. That's why you're alive, right?\" Clueless, The Musical is London's Trafalgar Theatre until 27 September 2025. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "From a lavish historical epic set in Sicily to a satire of Hollywood studios starring Seth Rogan, and the acclaimed final instalment of British Tudor drama Wolf Hall. It's right there in the title – you can't keep a Marvel hero down. Or off the screen. After three seasons originally made for Netflix (running from 2015 to 2018), the new Disney+ series brings back the familiar cast of heroes, villains and everything in between. Charlie Cox is Matt Murdoch, aka Daredevil, the blind attorney with superhuman senses that he had once used to fight crime at night, before giving it up at the end of season three. Vincent D'Onofrio is Wilson Fisk, the former mob boss known as Kingpin, now the mayor. \"Why did you stop being a vigilante?\" Fisk asks Murdoch over a friendly cup of coffee at a diner. No matter. That hiatus won't last much longer, as the punching, kicking and mask-wearing action begins. Jon Bernthal is Frank Castle, or Punisher, a brutal vigilante who, unlike Daredevil, never gave it a second thought. Daredevil: Born Again premieres 4 March in the US and 5 March in the UK on Disney+. Luchino Visconti's 1963 classic film, The Leopard, is still one of the most opulent, romantic, political-historical epics of all time, with Burt Lancaster as the Prince of Salina, head of a fading aristocratic family, and Alain Delon as his revolutionary nephew, Tancredi. Both are caught between the past and the future in 1860s Sicily during the upheaval that unified Italy into one country. Netflix has adapted Giuseppe di Lampedusa's novel, the basis for the film, into this lavish six-part series, cast largely with Italian actors and shot in locations throughout Sicily. Kim Rossi Stuart plays the Prince, the leopard of the title, clinging to his old ways. Saul Nanni is Tancredi, whose love affair with Angelica (Deva Cassel) forms the romantic centre of the story, even while revolutionaries storm the streets and Tancredi has to choose his own path, with his uncle or with a new order. The Leopard premieres 5 March on Netflix internationally In his consistently droll voice, John Mulaney has leap-frogged through genres, from a series of priceless stand-up specials to appearing in – and writing – instant-classic Saturday Night Live sketches like Lobster Diner, and last year's John Mulaney Presents: Everybody's in LA, a series of six live talk-show episodes presented over consecutive nights. At once sending up and using the tropes of an old-time talk show, Everybody's in LA was such a critical and popular hit that Mulaney returns with this 12-episode series, each show live once a week. Everybody's Live promises a similar meta/retro mix as the last run, which had some amazing, funny guests – David Letterman and Bill Hader on the same episode, a surprise appearance by Will Ferrell – viewer call-ins, and offbeat topics like coyotes in Los Angeles. Richard Kind returns in the role of announcer/sidekick, along with Saymo the delivery robot, in a show that is both goofy and satirical. Everybody's Live with John Mulaney premieres 12 March on Netflix internationally Stephen Graham is everything everywhere all at once these days (no bad thing). He plays a Victorian-era boxer in A Thousand Blows, which just premiered, and is both star and co-creator with Jack Thorne (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child) of this psychological drama which has an unsettling theme. Graham plays Ed Miller, whose 13-year-old son, Jamie, is accused of murdering a girl who went to his school. Ashley Waters (Top Boy) plays a detective investigating the murder, and Erin Doherty (the crime boss in A Thousand Blows) is the psychologist assigned to treat Jamie. Each of the four episodes is shot in one continuous take, playing out in real time, which might add to the tension. The real test will be how effective that strategy is. Adolescence is directed by Philip Barantini, who made the one-shot approach so effective in the 2021 film Boiling Point (which, need we add, stars Stephen Graham). Adolescence premieres 13 March on Netflix internationally In this drama that mixes elements of the police procedural with a family story of addiction, Amanda Seyfried plays Mickey Fitzgerald, a beat cop in Philadelphia assigned to the neighbourhood where she grew up, a place ravaged by the opioid crisis. When several women are serially murdered, she suspects the case might lead her to her sister, Kacey (Ashleigh Cummings), an addict and sex worker who has disappeared. The show weaves between past and present, with flashbacks to the sisters' fraught relationship and divergent paths, as Mickey deals with life as a single mother and with her increasing obsession with finding Kacey. The show has a lot to live up to. It is based on a bestselling novel by Liz Moore, who cowrote the series with its showrunner, Nikki Toscano. NPR called the book one of the Best of 2020, and if that's not enough, Barack Obama put it on his list of favourite books of the year. Long Bright River premieres 13 March on Peacock Ridley Scott directed the first episode of this crime series, which becomes more than the typical drugs-and-criminals thriller thanks to its lead actors. Brian Tyree Henry (Atlanta, If Beale Street Could Talk) and Wagner Moura (Civil War) play old friends in Philadelphia with a small-time scam. Posing as agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency, they pretend to raid drug houses while really searching for cash to steal. By the end of episode one, they have targeted the wrong meth lab, and are on the run from both real government agents and the dealers whose business they literally blew up in an explosion. Henry and Moura bring unusual sympathy to the characters as the show combines the tension of their life-or-death danger with the stories of the people they care about and try to protect. Henry's character is especially affecting in his love for the stepmother who raised him (Kate Mulgrew). Peter Craig, a co-writer of The Batman and Top Gun: Maverick, created the series, which has a gritty texture that recalls The Wire. Dope Thief premieres 14 March on Apple TV+ internationally Ellen Pompeo and Mark Duplass star as Kristine and Michael Barnett in a series  inspired by a tabloid-ready real-life case. The Barnetts adopt a seven-year-old Ukrainian orphan named Natalia Grace (Imogen Faith Reid), who has a rare form of dwarfism, and whose first adopted family has returned her. The trailer hints at a good deal of heightened drama, as Kristine begins to suspect that they do not know the truth about their child's age. \"Michael, I don't think she's a little girl,\" she says, a suspicion that eventually takes the couple all the way to court. Dule Hill plays a detective investigating the tangle of accusations and fears, and it is tangled. The actual events, which began in 2010, are so unusual and the saga so ongoing that it has already inspired three seasons of a documentary series on the Investigation Discovery Channel. Good American Family premieres 19 March on Hulu in the US and 7 May on Disney+ in the UK Netflix is calling this murder mystery from Shonda Rhimes's production company a  \"screwball whodunit,\" with Uzo Aduba as Cordelia Cupp, a brilliant detective investigating a murder in the White House during a state dinner. With a comic tone and a cast of 157 suspects, it's Upstairs Downstairs at the White House with a corpse, as Cupp questions everyone from the assistant usher (Susan Kelechi Watson) and the pastry chef (Bronson Pinchot) to the president's mother-in-law (Jane Curtain) and oldest friend (Ken Marino). Randall Park plays an FBI agent who investigates with Cordelia, and as the trailer reveals, Giancarlo Esposito plays the murder victim, who had the important job of chief usher and was not popular with his staff. The show was created by Paul William Davies, a writer on Rhimes's White House-set series Scandal, who has gone for a very different tone here. His goal for the show was to \"Keep it FUN,\" he told Netflix. \"I want people to be entertained, I want them to laugh.\" The Residence arrives in a very different political landscape to the one in which it was created, and it will be interesting to see whether finding laughter in the White House now lands as escapist entertainment or tone-deafness. The Residence premieres 20 March on Netflix internationally Viewers in the US have had to wait four months to see the series the Guardian called \"utter TV magic\" when it premiered on the BBC last November, but here it is. The second instalment of Wolf Hall, it is based on the last of Hilary Mantel's trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, the savvy but doomed advisor to Henry VIII. Just as Mantel set the standard for historical novels, the first Wolf Hall series, adapted from the first two books, did the same for smart, beautifully made historical TV dramas. Nine years later, the ensemble that put that first part together is back, on screen and off, with Mark Rylance as Cromwell, Damian Lewis as Henry and Jonathan Pryce as Cardinal Wolsey. The series was adapted by Peter Straughn, who was nominated for an Oscar this year for Conclave (he's good at writing men in robes) and directed by Peter Kosminsky. The story picks up in 1536, the blood still fresh from Anne Boleyn's head rolling, and although history tells us how badly it all ends, watching the court intrigue unfold here in such ravishing detail is exhilarating. Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light premieres 23 March on PBS in the US Hollywood studios are an irresistible target of satire, from Robert Altman's 1992 gem The Player to Armando Iannucci's recent series The Franchise. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the co-creators of this series, have now made them the subject of a very funny romp, overflowing with cameos from real-life actors and directors. Rogan plays Matt Remick, a production executive who longs to greenlight art films. That's an unlikely goal after he is promoted to head of Continental Studios, with the mandate to make commercial hits. One project his corporate bosses insist on: a film based on Kool-Aid. If a product-inspired movie worked for Barbie, why not a soft drink? The first episode includes cameos from Martin Scorsese and Steve Buscemi. Paul Dano, Olivia Wilde, Charlize Theron, Anthony Mackie and many others play outsized versions of themselves. And the casting of the regular characters is inspired. Ike Barniholtz plays Matt's second-in-command and best friend, Catherine O'Hara is the mentor whose job Matt took, and Kathryn Hahn the studio's brash head of publicity.

        "content": "The building of the Sydney Opera House began on 2 March 1959. But when BBC Tonight visited the construction site in 1965, it was plagued by technical problems, soaring costs, vacillating public opinion and political infighting. In 1965, BBC reporter Trevor Philpott sat overlooking Sydney Harbour as he tried to find the right metaphor to describe the vibrant, arching structures of Jørn Utzon's roof design for the Australian city's Opera House. \"It was a score of towering shells. It was a cluster of seagulls spreading concrete wings. It was a huddle of sailing boats with billowing concrete sails,\" said Philpott. He then added the caveat: \"And it was an unmitigated bitch to build.\" The fraught saga of the Sydney Opera House's construction began on 2 March 1959, 66 years ago this week. Six years after that, when BBC Tonight's Philpott went to see the building's progress, it was already years behind schedule, mired in spiralling costs, changing designs and escalating political tensions. To say it was having a difficult birth would be an understatement. The idea to build an opera house for the city had been proposed in the late 1940s by an acclaimed English conductor, Sir Eugene Goossens. At the time, Goossens was something of a celebrity in the classical music world, having carved out a successful career in the UK and the US. After World War Two, he had been lured to Sydney to become the director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music with the promise of a salary greater than that of the Australian Prime Minister, musicologist Dr Drew Crawford told the BBC podcast A Very Australian Scandal in 2023. The creation of a new, world-class music performance venue was the conductor's passion project. He had spied from his office window what he believed was the ideal site for it – the tram depot at Bennelong Point. Known to the local indigenous Gadigal people of the Eora nation as Tubowgule, it was a place where Aboriginal celebrations had been held for thousands of years. Throughout the 1950s, Goossens lobbied hard, trying to turn his dream into a reality. \"There were very few other people who could have that vision, articulate that vision, and have the ear of the Premier [of New South Wales], have the ear of the Prime Minister, be able to talk to people to get it going,\" said Dr Crawford. Goossens convinced the Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Cahill, that an opera house would reshape the world's view of Australia, that he had found the perfect site for it, and that they should launch \"a grand competition, open to the architects of all the world, to decide exactly what manner of a building they should put there\", said Philpott. \"They made only one condition, that nothing quite so remarkable should have been ever built before.\" Goossens himself would not get to see his ambition realised. In 1956, having just picked up his knighthood in the UK, he was detained upon his entry back into Australia, where his bags were searched and found to contain, among other things, smuggled pornography, compromising photographs and rubber masks. The resulting scandal, which involved affairs, erotica and witchcraft, completely scuppered the conductor's career in Sydney. He fled the country for Rome, traveling under the alias of Mr E Gray, never to return. However, the design competition went ahead as planned, with a panel of judges evaluating some 233 submitted entries. At the start 1957, the government announced that a largely unknown Danish architect, Utzon, was the unexpected winner. Part of the surprise at Utzon's success was that his entry had largely consisted of preliminary sketches and concept drawings. \"As far as building anything of any scale, he hadn't really done very much,\" Sir Jack Zunz, who worked on the project for the civil engineering firm Arup, told BBC Witness History in 2018. The judges' choice of Utzon's bold and imaginative design was not without controversy. \"From the first, it stirred the people of Sydney to breathless wonder and scalding abuse,\" said Philpott. \"It was called the Sydney Harbour monster, a piece of Danish pastry, a disintegrating circus tent.\" Premier Cahill, worried that the project might be derailed by adverse public opinion or political opposition, pushed for construction work to start early. This was despite the fact that Utzon was still finalising the building's actual design, and had yet to resolve critical structural issues. Although Utzon's design was thought to be one of the cheapest, there were still problems raising money for it, so a State Lottery was launched in 1957 to help fund the project. The initial estimate of the final cost of the Sydney Opera House was put at A£3.5m or A$7m – at the time, Australia's official currency was the pound, but was replaced by the dollar in 1966. The building was set to open on 26 January 1963: Australia Day. Both of these predictions would prove to be wildly and hopelessly optimistic. \"Right from the beginning, the house was full of trouble: human, mechanical, structural,\" reported Philpott. The building of the Opera House was divided into three distinct phases: construction of the podium, the roof shells, and the interior. Cahill, having persuaded the Minister of Transport to agree to the tram depot being demolished to build the podium, \"found the site was neither big enough nor strong enough to carry that structure that seemed on paper light enough to fly away,\" said Philpott. To bear the weight of the Opera House, the whole site needed to be extended and reinforced by driving over 550 steel-cased concrete shafts, each three feet in diameter, into land in and around Sydney Harbour. This extensive work, which had not been accounted for in either the construction's budget or its timescale, dragged on, hampered by bad weather. The podium would only be completed in January 1963 – the original date for when the Opera House was meant to open. But this would merely be the first of the project's delays and eye-watering extra costs. The Opera House's most distinctive feature, its roof shells which mimicked a ship's sails, were to present a whole other set of engineering headaches. Initially, the plan had been to make the roof out of steel coated with concrete. However, that design presented unwelcome noise problems for any performance taking place. \"The Opera House stars would have been singing above the sirens of the tugboats on the water outside, and the temperature variations would have caused the metal and concrete to rumble and crack like tropical thunder,\" said Philpott. Nobody had also fully understood the scale of the engineering challenge that the Opera House's daring curved roof surfaces presented. Since Utzon's entry lacked detailed engineering plans, civil engineering firm Arup had been brought in to work out how to construct the roof's complex shell structure. But despite trying multiple different redesigns, they could not make the structural calculations add up. \"The first thing Arup did when they were asked to collaborate, they took these free shapes and developed a series of mathematical models which, near as possible, matched Utzon's competition design. None of these shapes appeared buildable,\" Zunz told BBC Witness History. Another issue was that, because the roof was curved, each concrete rib that supported it would be different. That meant that instead of having just one mould that could be reused to cast all the supporting beams, each individual rib would need a separate one. This was prohibitively expensive. The answer, Utzon would later claim, came to him while he was peeling an orange. The architect realised that all segments of the roof could come from the geometry of a single sphere. By identifying which part of the sphere best suited the shapes they needed, a series of triangles each with one curved side could be cut from it, creating a variety of shells. These spherical shell segments could be broken down into individual components, which could be uniformly pre-cast in concrete and assembled onsite. \"He came back a week later and said, 'I've solved it.' And he made the scheme out of a sphere,\" said Arup's Zunz. \"But in so doing, he had changed the architecture quite radically.\" In History In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter. This elegant solution simplified the roof's construction and reduced waste, enabling the building of the vaulted roof to begin in 1963. But as the contractors worked on executing Utzon's vision, the project was dogged by labour disputes, design changes and rising material costs, making its budget balloon and its potential completion date disappear into the distance. \"By 1962, the cost had risen to A£12.5m, and now everybody admitted they were only guessing,\" said Philpott. \"The opening day was postponed and postponed again. It had been planned for Australia Day 1963, it was put off until early 1964, then until sometime in 1966, and now no one is bold enough even to predict the year the doors may eventually open.\" The project's biggest government supporter, Premier Cahill, had taken ill just months after building work had started. On his deathbed in 1959, he had made his Minister for Public Works, Norman Ryan, promise not to let the Opera House fail. Ryan, when interviewed by the BBC's Philpott in 1965, gamely made a spirited defence of the project, but by this time frustration with its mounting costs and endless delays was palpable. \"I wasn't sure whether to admit to working on it at the time,\" admitted Zunz. \"If you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted, and God knows what.\" Adding to this contentious atmosphere, a few months after Ryan's BBC interview, Robert Askin, who had vocally opposed the project, was elected the New South Wales Premier. He appointed Davis Hughes as the new Minister for Public Works, who clashed repeatedly with Utzon. Hughes, determined to rein in spending, began to challenge the architect's costs and schedules, demanding a full set of working drawings for the interiors – the next stage of the project. \"The whole situation started going downhill,\" said Zunz. \"Utzon couldn't, wouldn't, anyway didn't produce the documents his client desired.\" In retaliation, Hughes refused the payments demanded by the construction team, which left Utzon unable to pay his staff. In 1966, the Danish architect resigned from the project and left Australia, never returning to see his Opera House completed. Utzon's resignation led to a public outcry, with 1,000 people taking to Sydney's streets on 3 March 1966 to demand that he be reinstated. Instead, Hughes appointed a new panel of Australian architects to complete the interior as well as the glass walls. But if Hughes thought this would reduce costs and speed up the project, he was very much mistaken. The new team scrapped most of Utzon's plans for the interior and radically redesigned it. Utzon had envisioned a dual purpose for the main hall, as an opera venue and a concert hall, but this was now viewed as unworkable, leading to the already installed stage production machinery having to be demolished. The new design also meant that each of the hundreds of pieces of glass in the interior walls needed to be cut to a unique size and shape, which continued to pile on the costs. The Sydney Opera House's spiralling bill was pushed even higher when a labour dispute by union workers, over the dismissal of a worker and demands for better wages, culminated in a sit-in strike at the site in 1972. But the following year, the monumental undertaking that was the construction of the Sydney Opera House was finally completed. Ten years late and 14 times over its initial budget, it came in at a cost of A$102m (£51m). It was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973. The monarch praised the stunning building that had \"captured the imagination of the world\" while also wryly mentioning that \"I understand that its construction has not been totally without problems\". Utzon declined to attend its opening, writing to Premier Askin that he couldn't \"see anything positive\" in the interior work done by the Australian architects and it would not be possible for him \"to avoid making very negative statements\".

In September 2004, the Reception Hall was renamed the Utzon Room in his honour after being redesigned by him. In the years since its completion, acclaim for Sydney Opera House's visionary architecture has only grown. Its distinctive sculptural form has made it one of the most immediately recognisable buildings in the world. More than 10.9m people visit it annually, and it has come to epitomise the Australian national identity, its soaring roof a celebration of creativity, culture and ambition in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. As a venue, it has played host to everyone from Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald and Sammy Davis Jnr to The Cure, Björk and Massive Attack. In 1980, Arnold Schwarzenegger won his final body-building title there, and 10 years later anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela made one of his first major speeches from its steps following his release from prison. In 2004, Cathy Freeman, the first Aboriginal athlete to win an individual Olympic gold medal, opened the Olympic torch relay from outside the building. Its eye-catching roof is illuminated every year as part of Vivid Sydney, the city's festival of light, music and ideas, and in 2017, stories of Indigenous Australia told in vibrant animations were projected onto it. In 2007, the building that had been brought about by a combination of art, engineering and sheer bloody-minded perseverance was formally recognised as a World Heritage Site by Unesco. On recommending its inclusion, the International Council on Monuments and Sites declared: \"The Sydney Opera House stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th Century but in the history of humankind.\" -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

        "content": "In the past month alone, shadowy portraits have been found hidden in longstanding masterpieces by Titian and Picasso. What can they and other such discoveries tell us? Something's stirring. Every few weeks, it seems, brings news of a sensational discovery in the world of art – of paintings hidden under other paintings and vanished visages twitching beneath the varnish of masterpieces whose every square millimetre we thought we knew. This past month alone has brought to light the detection of mysterious figures trapped beneath the surface of works by Titian and Picasso. But what are we to make of this slowly swelling collection of secret stares – these absent presences that simultaneously delight and disturb? In early February, it was revealed that researchers at the Andreas Pittas Art Characterization Laboratories at the Cyprus Institute, using advanced imaging and a new multi-modal scanner combining different techniques, had proved the existence of an upside-down portrait of a mustachioed man holding a quill beneath the Italian Renaissance master Titian's painting Ecce Homo, 1570-75. On its surface, Titian's canvas portrays a bedraggled Jesus, hands bound by ropes, standing shoulder to shoulder with a sumptuously dressed Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor who will sentence him to death. What is this strange, erased, anachronistic scribe doing here and what is he trying to tell us? The presence of the hidden portrait, who peers imperceptibly through the craquelure – those alluring cracks in old master paintings – was first described by the art historian Paul Joannides and its significance to the surface narrative is more than incidental. While the identity of the topsy-turvy figure has yet to be determined, it is clear he helped shape the wrenching composition under which he has been buried for the past 450 years. The analysis of the materiality of the painting's layers in Cyprus has shown that the contours of the hidden figure's face dictated the curve of ropes binding Jesus's hands – establishing notes of harmony between the successive and seemingly contrary compositions. That sense of quiet collaboration between layers of paint – between what is there and what used to be there – is more striking still in the hidden countenance of a woman found by conservators at The Courtauld Institute of Art beneath a painting from Pablo Picasso's Blue Period – a portrait of the artist's friend and sculptor Mateu Fernández de Soto. Also discovered with the use of infrared imaging technology, the portrait of the as-yet unidentified woman is rendered in an earlier, more impressionistic style, and appears, when brought to the surface, to be whispering into de Soto's ear, as if the past and present had merged into a single suspended moment. In most instances, these buried portraits are merely the ghosts of rejected compositions that we were never intended to see – and could not have, were it not for the aid of advanced imaging tools that allow experts safely to peer beneath the paint without harming a work's surface. X-rays uncover hidden sketches, while infrared reflectography is capable of exposing subtle details masked by old varnish – details which, once glimpsed, are impossible to unknow. Once revealed, these portraits demand to be reckoned with. What follows is a short survey of some of the most intriguing and mysterious portraits – very often self-portraits – found wriggling restlessly beneath familiar masterpieces: unsettling presences that remain forever immeasurably close and worlds away. Think of Rembrandt and we tend to think first of that dim, imperishable realm in which his sitters sit outside of time – an eternal stage crafted from charcoal and sombrous umber. What we don't think of is giddy greens and garish vermilions igniting the space with vibrancy and verve. But that is exactly what researchers found staring back at them when they subjected the Dutch master's painting, An Old Man in Military Costume, to macro X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) imaging and infrared reflectography. Trapped beneath Rembrandt's meditation on mortality, a giddy ghost of jaunty youth clad in raffish reds and incorrigible verdigris intensifies the poignancy of his masterwork. With some paintings, the more we see the less we know. Take Artemisia Gentileschi's portrait of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, 1619. X-ray analysis of the Italian Baroque artist's work undertaken in 2019 revealed that she began the work as a self-portrait – one that closely resembles an earlier, and similarly entitled, Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria, begun around 1615. Disentangling the two works' faces is tricky but scholars now think that the final work – which swaps a turban for a crown and a piercing stare for a pious, heavenly gaze – blends elements of the artist's own likeness with those of Caterina de' Medici, daughter of the Grand Duke Ferdinando de' Medici, who commissioned the work. The result is proof that while an artist may be able to let go of a painting, a painting can never completely let go of the artist. Caravaggio only signed one painting during his lifetime and did so with ghoulish flair in a squiggle of blood at the bottom of the largest painting he ever made, The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist, 1608. But that is hardly the only time the Italian master inserted a semblance of himself into his paintings. In 2009, scholars using advanced reflectography penetrated the cracked surface of Caravaggio's depiction of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, to rehabilitate a tiny self-portrait that he had secreted in the reflection of the carafe (an almost subliminal detail that clumsy restoration efforts had obscured after the portrait-within-a-portrait was first discovered in 1922). This strange, distorted, now-you-see-it-now-you-don't selfie in the vessel of wine is key to the work's meaning, amplifying as it does themes of drunken illusion and elastic identity that are central to Caravaggio's painting. On the surface, Young Woman Powdering Herself is a playful meditation on how subject and style overlap. Here, Georges Seurat employs his pioneering pointillist technique of countless tiny dots to depict his mistress, Madeleine Knobloch, as she scatters her own flurry of powdery specks across her face. The dabs of paint seem to swirl in the air, all but clogging it – metaphorically powdering, too, anyone who stops to stare. These deftly deployed dabs of paint reveal and erase in equal measure, as if conjuring a world only to blot it out again. That sense of brilliant obliteration is intensified with the discovery of a hidden self-portrait – Seurat's only known one – in the open window which he later concealed beneath another flurry of dots depicting a vase of flowers. How dotty is that? Some people refuse to be forgotten, no matter how hard you scrub them from your memory. Italian modernist Amedeo Modigliani's famous Portrait of a Girl, 1917, is a compelling case in point. Some scholars suspect that the full-length portrait of a woman, concealed beneath the visible image, may depict an ex-lover with whom Modigliani ended a relationship a year earlier. In 2021, two PhD candidates at the University of London used Artificial Intelligence to reconstruct this hidden portrait, which strikingly resembles Modigliani's former muse and mistress, Beatrice Hastings. While the identity of both women, surface and hidden, remains uncertain, the layering reinforces themes of concealment and masking in Modigliani's work. In his painting La Cinquième Saison, 1943, René Magritte portrays in profile two nearly identical men in dark suits and bowler hats – props that often signal the presence of his alter-ego in the artist's work. Both men hold small, framed paintings under their arms as they walk towards each other. The trajectory of their strides suggests not so much an imminent collision as a near miss – an eclipse, as one figure and painting slips behind the other. It somehow seems fitting that this painting – this painting of shuffling paintings – has been found, with the use of infrared reflectography, to be hiding under its surface another painting altogether: a portrait of a mysterious woman, who at once bears a strong resemblance to the artist's wife, Georgette, and has features that are wholly distinct. The discovery of the hidden portrait merely amplifies themes of riddling duality in the work of an artist known for his treacherously teasing images. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "Abraham Lincoln's wife was long attacked for everything from her spending to her lack of emotional restraint. But with two new plays about her, she is finally getting better press. During last month's US presidential inauguration, as ever during these quadrennial celebrations, fierce interest focused on the First Lady. Much was made of Melania Trump's dresses, her enigmatic smiles, and especially the navy-blue wide-brimmed boater-style hat  she wore for the swearing-in. Was the hat a deliberate choice, to shield her face from the prying eyes of the public? No one could say, but legions speculated. How unenviable is the lot of the President's wife, lacking in formal power but constantly judged – expected to be immaculately turned out, and to remain, in conduct, ever above reproach. The court of public opinion has found no First Lady more wanting than Mary Todd Lincoln, wife of Abraham Lincoln. Her husband, who emancipated the slaves, and saved the union, enjoys near-universal adulation, while Mrs Lincoln has been the subject of criticism and disapproval since her first days in Washington in 1861 when she embarked on plans for a lavish redecoration of the White House. She travelled to New York for a shopping spree, and reporters followed her everywhere. One for The New York Herald wrote: \"Mrs Lincoln, who has been engaged since her arrival in making large purchases at some of the leading merchants, was out yesterday enjoying herself in the usual way.\" Such reports did not go down well in the besieged, wartime capital. Indeed, the loyalty of the First Lady, who hailed from a slave-holding family, and had three half-brothers in the Confederate Army, was questioned throughout the Civil War. Even after her husband was shot on 14 April 1865 by Confederate supporter John Wilkes Booth, as he sat beside her in Ford's Theater, the public didn’t embrace their hero's widow. In 1875, her own son had her committed to an insane asylum. And yet today, in the era of TikTok, X, Instagram and Facebook, where social esteem rises and falls capriciously on clicks and likes, the maligned Mary Todd Lincoln is getting some compassionate reassessment on the stage, most particularly in Mrs President, a new play by US historian, writer and artist John Ransom Phillips opening this week at London's Charing Cross Theatre. This two-hander centres on the relationship between Mary Todd Lincoln (played by Miriam Grace Edwards), and Mathew Brady, considered the father of American photo-journalism (Sam Jenkins-Shaw) who took iconic pictures of Abraham Lincoln, his family, and the battlefields of the bloody US Civil War. The new play imagines the First Lady, coming to Brady’s studio to sit for her portrait, aware that she is an object of suspicion because of her southern heritage, and seeking an \"image that will define history’s view of me\". Brady declares he has the power to do that. \"I shape the image of people who shape America. Past. Present. Future,\" he says. In Ransom Phillips' depiction, Mrs Lincoln demands to be addressed as Mrs President, and engages in an on-going verbal tug of war with Brady over how she should be portrayed. The play asks who controls the revelatory public image, the subject or the artist? This question transcends time and place, but has specific resonance for the former First Lady who sought, and believed she never received, proper recognition during her life for all she had done, and suffered. Later scenes follow Mrs Lincoln into her widowhood, and other controversial historical figures of mid-19th-Century America – abolitionist John Brown, Chief Justice Roger Taney, and naturalist John James Audubon – appear on stage, depicted by Jenkins-Shaw. Mrs President is a daringly kaleidoscopic look at the ownership of self. In truth, Mary Todd Lincoln and Mathew Brady's relationship was a limited one. She did pose for Brady at his studio at 625 Pennsylvania Avenue in November of 1861. When she saw the photographs, she was unhappy with how she looked and instructed that they all be destroyed, except for one she deemed \"passable\", in which she stands, and her face is seen in profile; Brady ignored this request and kept all the photographs in his archives. And later in Lincoln's term, she returned to the studio a few times, but it's not known if Brady took any other of her portraits, as he deputised much studio work to his assistants. Ransom Philips tells the BBC his aim with the play wasn't to document history but rather \"to rescue Mary Todd Lincoln from ridicule and caricature, and to show her as fully a person, a woman of complexity and depth of feeling – possessing the kind of emotionality that men often lack\". And his view of Brady is not totally benign. \"Brady is an artist, like I am, and I know artists can be tyrannous.\" In a wildly different way, another theatre production currently running in New York is also sympathetic to the 16th First Lady. Oh, Mary! has been a huge word-of-mouth hit since it first premiered at the city's Lucille Lortel Theatre in February 2024, before transferring to Broadway in the summer. This comedy, written by Cole Escola and described by The New York Times as \"gleefully tasteless\" and an \"unhinged historical fantasia\", depicts Mary as a lascivious, self-centered alcoholic who yearns to escape the White House and her nasty, neglectful husband so as to become a cabaret star. Until Escola turned over the role to Betty Gilpin last month, they themselves starred as Mary – in drag, shaking a mop-like wig of black barrel curls. All joking aside, and Oh, Mary! has numerous slapstick moments, the play's inspiration was Escola’s own sense of identification with Mary – a woman who could be \"too much\" and was \"trapped in this role she was wrong for\", as Escola explained in an interview on NPR last year. Perhaps unintentionally, Escola and Phillips have joined a century-long debate among historians over how Mary Lincoln should best be understood. Was she an energetic, ambitious young woman who recognised genius in Lincoln, a rough-hewn country lawyer, and propelled him to greatness? Or was she a volatile wife who made Lincoln's domestic life a living hell, hurling accusations ­– and on occasion crockery – at him during regular fits of rage? Was she first unhinged by grief in 1850, when she lost her son Eddie at age three to tuberculosis? Or was it the loss of a second son, Willy, 12 years later, that really drove her mental health decline? Did she take bribes and pad expense accounts as First Lady? Or did she act as a valuable helpmeet, giving President Lincoln sage advice? \"In the public imagination she's multiple people – it all depends on who is examining her,\" historian Jason Emerson tells the BBC. Author of seven books on the Lincoln family, including The Madness of Mary Lincoln, Emerson is currently assembling a complete volume of the former First Lady's letters for the Lincoln Studies Center of the University of Illinois. \"Mary was a complex person, very human, and she made mistakes, as Lincoln did too. She is essentially a tragic figure.\" Loss haunted Mary's life starting at the age of six, when her mother died. After Mary's father remarried and sired nine children with his new wife, love was a scant commodity in the family home in Lexington, Kentucky. Mary escaped to Springfield, Illinois, where she lived with her elder sister. Vivacious in conversation and praised, too, for her pretty face and milky complexion, young Mary had many admirers. She found in Lincoln a man who shared her passion for poetry, theatre and Whig politics, and who was also nearly 10 years older and more than a foot taller. But rather than provide her with the steady paternal affection she missed out on as a child, Lincoln was often away from home, working as a lawyer on the Illinois judicial circuit. As introverted as his wife was extroverted, Lincoln struggled to respond to her emotional pleas for attention and sympathy. \"Temperamentally they were very different,\" Emerson says. \"And as she aged, her mental problems got worse, consistent with bi-polar issues.\" Emerson's study of Mary Lincoln and her extended family has convinced him that she suffered from the condition formerly known as manic depressive disorder, not widely diagnosed in the 19th Century. The stresses on both Lincolns during their time in wartime Washington were immense, and Mary was determined to dress fashionably and entertain lavishly. \"She thought of herself as the Queen of America, doing what she was supposed to do as First Lady\" says Emerson. \"Her narcissism was perhaps her greatest vulnerability.\" But when their son Willie succumbed to typhoid in 1862, she refused to get out of bed for weeks and grieved so copiously her husband rebuked her. More like this: • What do these First Lady portraits reveal? • The Abraham Lincoln portrait that was a fake • The 17th-Century painting that unlocks Trump's portrait Perhaps it was inevitable that this often unrestrained woman, would continue to get bad press after her death in 1882. William Herndon, Lincoln's law partner, reinforced the most unflattering views of Mary Lincoln, in the biography he co-wrote in 1889 titled Herndon's Lincoln: The True Story of a Great Life. Herndon and Mary despised each other during Lincoln's lifetime and competed for his attention. In private Herndon called her a \"she-wolf\". For many decades, Herndon's interpretation stood – Mary Todd Lincoln was regarded as a harridan married to a saint. But in the 1980s and 1990s, when scholars began to seriously reassess the role of women in history, the troubled First Lady got a fresh look. In 1987, Jean Baker, a historian at Maryland's Goucher College published Mary Todd Lincoln: A Biography, portraying the Lincoln marriage as fundamentally tolerant and loving, and Mary as a vital, behind-the-scenes participant in her husband's political career, consoling, advising and encouraging. That view in turn, was contradicted by renowned Lincoln scholar Michael Burlingame in his 2021 book An American Marriage: The Untold Story of Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd. Burlingame believes Lincoln was made miserable by his wife, who, he believes, at times physically abused him, and posits she seduced Lincoln to force him to marry her – they were wed on a day's notice, their first child born a scant nine months later. And Burlingame is certain, based on evidence in US government archives, that she solicited bribes and sold permits and pardons while in the White House. Yet, the author credits Mary with fuelling Lincoln’s rise. \"If he hadn't married a woman who was so ambitious and so willing to prod her husband and to goad him... he may not have gone as far as he did,\" the historian said in a recent interview for the History Unplugged podcast. Moreover, Lincoln's remarkable ability to deal with difficult people, a gift constantly on display during his Presidency, had been honed by plenty of practice at home, in Burlingame's view. Author, too, of the definitive Abraham Lincoln: A Life, (2009) Burlingame was among numerous experts consulted by director Steven Spielberg for his 2012 hit film, Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis as the president and Sally Field as Mary Lincoln. The film portrays the First Lady in a generally positive light, and husband and wife as closely bonded. And yet Burlingame realised that Spielberg and scriptwriter Tony Kushner had closely studied his biography – which included his hypothesis about the hasty Lincoln wedding – when Day-Lewis (as Lincoln) and Field (as Mary Lincoln) argue over their eldest son Robert joining the army. He's in favour, she's opposed, and Mary accuses her husband of never liking the boy. \"You've always blamed Robert for being born, for trapping you in a marriage that's only ever given you grief,\" she says. \"I almost fell out of my seat,\" the historian recalled on the podcast. But even Burlingame at his most critical considers Mary Todd Lincoln more to be pitied than despised, considering that three of her four sons predeceased her, and her husband was murdered before her eyes. And it's one of the pleasures of the play Mrs President to see the heroine put up a fight for her own identity, and ignore the often harsh and deprecating judgements rained down upon her both before and after her death. Mrs President is at Charing Cross Theatre, London until March 16. Oh Mary! is booking at the Lyceum Theatre, New York until 28 June. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

        "headline": "£50k reward for 'great' artist Orlik's missing works",
        "author": "Sophie Parker",
        "published_date": "18 February 2025",
        "summary": "The search continues for work by artist Henry Orlik, 78, which was lost when he was evicted in 2022.",
        "content": "A re-discovered artist described as a \"great\" is offering a £50,000 reward in the search for dozens of his missing works. Henry Orlik, 78, from Swindon, has made £1.6m from his surrealist art work in the past year, with all the sales coming from two exhibitions. While he had work displayed beside the likes of Salvador Dali in the 1970s, Orlik became an artistic recluse some decades ago and is now in poor health. After being evicted from his social housing in London while recovering from a stroke in 2022, his possessions - including a large amount of his work - disappeared, and the search is on to find them. Orlick currently lives in his childhood home in Swindon, where other works had been safely stored. Family friend Jan Pietruszka said he had been sorting through them, with some items going to the recent exhibitions for sale. He said Orlik remained desperate to find the missing works lost during his eviction and \"my brief is find them at all cost\". \"He's getting weaker all the time. His health situation is deteriorating. He's quite depressed that we're not making great progress in finding these paintings,\" he explained. Mr Pietruszka said his friend struggled to speak much now. \"He's very deprecating about his work,\" he added. \"When it comes to the money side, he's ambivalent, he's not really interested. The subject always reverts back to, 'Can you get the paintings back?'.\"  It was initially thought that 78 works had been lost when Orlick was evicted from his London flat and could not get back inside. Now, it is believed at least 90 pieces - potentially hundreds - are missing. The £50,000 reward is for the recovery of all the pieces, as there has still been no confirmation of their whereabouts. Some of the artwork is enormous - life size or larger and already on a frame - and would be easily noticed as a result. Interpretations of Marilyn Monroe were among them. \"Nobody in their right mind would throw that in the skip,\" said Mr Pietruszka. Hundreds of sketches and work laid out flat were in an architects chest that was in the London home too, including several of his own copies of the Mona Lisa. A lot of Orlik's work is not signed, but one of his specialisms is something called \"excitations\", his method of composing a picture using small squiggles. Orlik paints with incredible accuracy and tiny brush strokes, but has mastered different styles. Marlborough art dealer and gallery owner Grant Ford has been working with Mr Pietruszka and organising the exhibitions. He said he could hardly believe what he was seeing when one of Orlik's works was first put in front of him. \"I've never come across an artist quite like this,\" he said. \"As a specialist, I think his imagination is extraordinary.\" Mr Ford has three decades of experience at Sotheby's and can be seen as an expert on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow. He said that Orlik \"should be considered one of our greats\". \"I think had he not turned his back on the commercial art world in the 70s, he would have been one of the really big names. \"Now is a critical time because his health is deteriorating,\" said Mr Ford.  Mr Ford said they had had interest from all over the world, including the US and China. As a young man, Orlik spent some time in New York in the 1970s and an exhibition is being organised there for this year. Due to Orlik's art not being sold for decades, the gallery owner had to start from scratch in working out how to price them. Some have gone for more than £40,000. Mr Ford and Mr Pietruszka said they were determined to find the bulk of the missing work with this reward - not just one or two pieces. Anyone with information about the works' whereabouts has been urged to contact the Winsor Birch gallery. Follow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "author": "Greg McKevitt",
        "published_date": "27 January 2025",
        "summary": "After being sent to the Nazi death camp in 1943, Anita Lasker survived by playing in its women's orchestra. In 1996, she spoke to the BBC about her ordeal.",
        "content": "The Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated by Soviet troops on 27 January 1945. Anita Lasker, a Jewish teenager, managed to survive there simply because the camp orchestra needed a cello player. Now aged 99, Anita Lasker-Wallfisch is the last remaining survivor of the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz. At the age of 19, she was interviewed by the BBC on 15 April 1945, the day of the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen death camp where she had been transferred six months earlier. Interviewed in German, the language she grew up speaking, she said: \"First, I would like to say a few words about Auschwitz. The few who have survived are afraid that the world will not believe what happened there.\" Warning: This article contains graphic details of the Holocaust  She continued: \"A doctor and a commander stood on the ramp when the transports arrived, and sorting was done right before our eyes. This means they asked for the age and health condition of the new arrivals. The unsuspecting newcomers tended to report any ailments, thereby signing their death sentences. They particularly targeted children and the elderly. Right, left, right, left. To the right was life; to the left, the chimney.\" When she first arrived at the Auschwitz unloading platform known as the ramp, her casual comment that she played the cello was enough to change the direction of her life. \"Music was played to accompany the most terrible things,\" she said. The then Anita Lasker barely spoke German in public again for 50 years after World War Two, but when she was growing up, her hometown of Breslau was part of Germany. Now known as Wrocław, it has been part of Poland since the end of the war. Lasker's mother Edith was a talented violinist and her father Alfons was a successful lawyer. As the youngest of three daughters, she grew up in a happy home where music and other cultural pursuits were encouraged. She knew at an early age that she wanted to be a cellist, but outside the sanctuary of her family home, darker forces were stirring. She recalled on a BBC television documentary in 1996: \"We were the typical assimilated German-Jewish family. We went to a little private school, and I suddenly heard, 'Don't give the Jew the sponge,' and I thought, 'What is all this?'\" By 1938, as antisemitism took hold in Nazi Germany, Lasker's parents couldn't find a cello tutor in Breslau who would teach a Jewish child. She was sent to Berlin to study, but had to rush back to her parents after a night of murder and mayhem. On 9 November 1938, the insidious persecution of Jewish people turned violent as Nazis smashed the windows of homes, businesses and synagogues on Kristallnacht or \"the night of broken glass\". Back at home, Lasker's parents continued to instil a love of culture in their children, as \"nobody can take that away from us\". Her eldest sister Marianne escaped in 1939 on the Kindertransport, the mission which took thousands of children to safety in Britain just before the war. By 1942, even as \"the world was falling to pieces\", her father still had Anita and her sister Renate discussing sophisticated works such as Friedrich Schiller's tragic play Don Carlos. However, it was \"obvious what was going to happen\", she said. In April 1942, the dreaded order came for her parents to report to a certain location within 24 hours. \"We walked through Breslau, not just my parents but a whole column of people, to this particular point and said goodbye. That was the end. I only understood what my parents must have gone through when I became a parent myself. By then, one had already started to suppress the luxury of feelings.\" Anita and Renate were sent to a Jewish orphanage, but they soon hatched a plan to escape from Nazi Germany. Posing as women on their way home to unoccupied France, they set off with two friends for Breslau railway station clutching forged papers. The plan failed and they were arrested by officers of the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police force. Anita served about 18 months in jail on charges of forgery, aiding the enemy and attempted escape, but at least she was relatively safe there. \"Prison is not a pleasant place to be in, but it's not a concentration camp,\" she said. \"Nobody kills you in a prison.\" In 1943, because of overcrowding in Breslau prison, any remaining Jewish people were relocated to concentration camps. Anita was put on a train to be taken to Auschwitz, and Renate was sent two weeks later. Anita arrived in the camp at night to find a terrible scene: \"I remember it was very noisy and totally bewildering. You had no idea where you were. Noisy with the dogs, people screaming, a horrible smell... You'd arrived in hell, really.\" Upon arrival, she was tattooed and shaved by Auschwitz prisoners who were eager for any news about the war. \"I said, 'Look, I can't tell you too much because I've been in prison for a long time,' and casually mentioned that I played the cello. And this girl said, 'Oh, that is very good. You might be saved.' The situation was unbelievable, really. I was naked, I had no hair, I had a number on my arm, and I had this ridiculous conversation. She went and got Alma Rosé, who was the conductor of the orchestra, so I became a member of the famous Women's Orchestra.\" In History In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter. Alma Rosé was a niece of composer Gustav Mahler, while her father was leader of the Vienna Philharmonic. The violinist ran the camp orchestra with fearsome professionalism, according to Lasker: \"She succeeded in making us so worried about what we were going to play and whether we were playing well that we temporarily didn't worry about what was going to happen to us.\" Using instruments stolen from other people who had been brought to the camp, the orchestra played its limited repertoire of military music. \"Our job was to play marches for the columns that worked outside the camp when they marched out, and in the evening when they came back in,\" she said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 1996, Lasker said that while Rosé set \"enormously high standards\", she did not think it was because of a fear of being murdered if they failed to play well. \"It was an escape somehow into excellence,\" she said. \"Somehow you come to terms with the fact that eventually they're going to get you, but whilst they haven't got you, you just carry on. I think one of the ingredients of survival was to be with other people. I think anybody on their own really didn't have a chance.\" Rosé did not survive the war, dying of suspected botulism in April 1944. Lasker said: \"I think we owe our lives to Alma. She had a dignity which imposed itself even on the Germans. Even the Germans treated her as if she were a member of the human race.\" The music stopped in October 1944 when the women were transferred to Belsen, a concentration camp where there was no orchestra. Conditions there were unimaginably awful. Lasker said: \"It wasn't actually an extermination camp – it was a camp where people perished. There were no gas chambers there, no need for gas chambers – you just died of disease, of starvation.\" The liberation of Belsen by British troops in April 1945 saved her life. \"I think another week and we probably wouldn't have made it because there was no food and no water left,\" she said.

Renate went on to work as an author and journalist, moving to France with her husband in 1982. She died in 2021, 11 days shy of her 97th birthday. Marianne, the eldest sister who was brought to safety on the Kindertransport, died in childbirth soon after the war. \"Such are the ironies of fate,\" she told the Guardian in 2005. Anita pursued a career as a successful musician, becoming a founder member of the English Chamber Orchestra. On a visit to Paris, she was put in touch with Peter Wallfisch, a piano student and fellow refugee whom she remembered from her school days in Breslau. They married in 1952 and had two children, cello player Raphael and psychotherapist Maya. While Lasker and her husband communicated with each other in \"a total mixture of languages\", she admitted that \"it would have been totally impossible for me to speak German to my children\". For decades, she vowed never again to set foot on German soil, fearing that anyone of a certain age could have been \"the very person who murdered my parents\". With the passage of time, she softened her stance, and by 2018 she was invited to Berlin to address politicians in the Bundestag, the German parliament. She said: \"As you see, I broke my oath – many, many years ago – and I have no regrets. It's quite simple: hate is poison and, ultimately, you poison yourself.\" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

        "content": "\"It's about what speaks to you\": Displaying paintings, prints, textiles and sculptures can all help create a fresh living space for the new year – here's how, according to the experts. January is a popular time of year to refresh priorities – and perhaps our surroundings too, creating a new mood for a new year. New artworks can transform a living space, and also inspire future interests, intentions, or the desire for fresh goals. Even repositioning our existing paintings, prints and photographs can revitalise a home and feel like a new start. Imaginatively chosen and displayed art can both revive cherished memories and prompt feelings of wellbeing – and it can change the whole ambience of a space. Abstract art, for instance, evokes moods in a non-literal, suggestive way – a large painting or print dominated by loose, expressionistic mark-making can give a home a romantic, free-spirited feel, while a more hard-edged, graphic style gives a space a modern, urban feel. Acquiring and displaying art isn't the preserve of homeowners, either; in fact, it's a great way to make a rental home feel more personal, without having to redecorate – and your pictures can move on when you do. It's this flexibility that makes art such a useful element of home décor – artworks can be arranged, then reconfigured to change the character of a room. \"A piece doesn't have to be in one location forever,\" says Katherine Kittoe, founder of Kittoe Contemporary, an online and physical art gallery and art consultancy that promotes emerging and established artists. \"A re-hang of artworks every few years – similar in principle to re-hangs in large public galleries, though obviously on a more modest scale – can be hugely rewarding and refreshing.\" This, though, raises the practical but important question of how to repair walls dented by holes left after hanging. \"Small nails are your best friend – they're easy to patch up with spackling paste when it’s time to move out,\" says Cathy Glazer, founder of Artfully Walls, a curated site for art-buyers in the UK and US. \"Lightweight pieces can be hung with thin nails and hooks from a basic picture-hanging kit. Most standard picture-hangers hold up to 30lbs. It's easier still to lean art on ledges or on stacks of books, mantelpieces or consoles for a very casual look.\" Of course, when art is added to a home, it must coexist with furniture and homeware accumulated over time. Yet it needn't vie for attention with existing elements or get visually lost among them – it can be artfully displayed adjacent to homeware with similar qualities, for example echoing the bold, colourful pattern in a rug or the sensual curves of ceramics. And it can be shown with ephemera – from postcards to family snaps – to create aesthetically pleasing juxtapositions. Wall-hung art can counterbalance the bulky, imposing look of furniture that occupies a permanent spot, such as sofas, according to Sophie Goldhill, co-founder of Liddicoat & Goldhill and its interior design arm, Hector Interiors: \"A striking painting can serve as a visual focal point paired with sofas and tables, and can offset the weight of larger pieces that could otherwise dominate a space,\" she tells the BBC. And introducing a new artwork into a room can make the space more cohesive, Goldhill adds. \"Art offers an opportunity to link different design elements, such as contrasting materials or colours, in a space, ensuring it doesn't feel disjointed. A thoughtfully chosen piece of art can reflect or complement tones in fabrics or wood, tying the room's design together.\" More like this: • The nine paint colours that can transform a home • Inside eight of the best fashion designers' homes • Why influencers are facing a pushback Opting for usable art can make buying and displaying artworks fun and accessible. A set of coasters and placemats – created with images by UK photographer Martin Parr and sold by art platform Plinth – is a good example. The aptly food-themed creations feature kitsch, close-up photos of cocktails filled with maraschino cherries, ice cream or tea in traditional cups and saucers. Food is also a major theme in the work of UK artist Selina Snow, whose joyful pieces depict mouth-watering delicacies from around the world – from colourful sushi to the humble full English breakfast. Snow has built up an eclectic collection of art and personal memorabilia that includes paintings and prints by her late father, Peter Snow, an artist and theatre designer, and myriad posters, textiles, objects and artefacts acquired on her travels. These are displayed in her home in the New Forest, Hampshire, alongside her own artworks, against a mainly neutral backdrop of grey and white walls. The buttercup yellow fireplace in Snow's living room has informed the choice of objects displayed on the mantelpiece and the art on the wall above it. A Balinese theatre mask representing a devil's head and a bust by artist Corin Johnson reminiscent of Marlene Dietrich, both of a similar height, stand at either end of the mantelpiece. Above it hangs an abstract painting featuring a pattern of yellow spots that echo the colour of the fireplace. \"I like the way the bust and mask balance each other and frame the painting,\" Snow tells the BBC. But Snow doesn't see her combinations of objects as simply toning chromatically. \"I don't want pieces to blend together so they lose their individual character, but so they enhance each other. I like to link colours but not obviously. I've got a sculpture of a violinist standing on a sulphur yellow table that picks up on a black pattern detail in a painting above it.\" She also pairs very different pieces that nevertheless share the same motifs. In Snow's bedroom is a wooden headboard carved with flower shapes by her late husband, sculptor Richard Austin; above it is a painting of flowers. Snow puts postcard-sized reproductions of paintings in inexpensive frames to elevate them and make them stand out. But for original artworks, she recommends investing in a professional framing service in order to preserve them well. Roberto Ekholm, a London-based artist, curator and art advisor, who has mounted art shows in his own home, raises a similar point: \"Be careful how you look after the medium. Don't let direct sunlight fall on framed paintings. You might have to install a UV protective window film over glass in brighter spots.\" Ekholm also points out that while sculpture might be associated by many with monumental works in galleries, it has a place in the home, too. \"It can be limiting using only tables, plinths or floor space to display sculptures,\" he says. \"At home, I like to arrange mine on affordable free-floating shelves at different heights and in various sizes, which creates an interesting domestic display.\" While Snow and Ekholm have art collections that grew organically, aided by long-standing art-world connections, many people establish theirs from scratch. So what criteria should apply when you're acquiring your first original artworks? \"Visit art exhibitions and auctions to explore what kind of art resonates with you,\" advises Kittoe. She cites the London Art Fair (on later this month), Affordable Art Fair and British Art Fair as good places in the UK to source art, as well as art trails and open-studio events. Kittoe also suggests making use of a \"try before you buy\" service: \"Many galleries allow you to see works in your own space before committing to the purchase. This can be useful as homes are so different to a brightly lit gallery, and this arrangement allows you to see the works at different times of the day and try them in different parts of the house. When hanging several pictures together, play with potential configurations by laying them out on the floor before committing them to fixed spots on the wall.\" In the end, go with what feels right for you. As Cathy Glazer puts it: \"Whether it's travel posters, collages or fleamarket finds, your collection should reflect what resonates with you. But if you're unsure where to begin, it can help to adhere to a theme, for example a grouping of botanicals, portraits or black-and-white photography. Choosing art can feel intimidating but it's not about right or wrong, it's about what speaks to you.\" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "The colour survives in the work of 17th Century Spanish colonial painters, a symbol of the wealth that ultimately doomed the Maya, writes Devon Van Houten Maldonado. In 17th Century Europe, when Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens painted their famous masterworks, ultramarine blue pigment made from the semi-precious lapis lazuli stone was mined far away in Afghanistan and cost more than its weight in gold. Only the most illustrious painters were allowed to use the costly material, while lesser artists were forced to use duller colours that faded under the sun. It wasn’t until the industrial revolution in the 19th Century that a synthetic alternative was invented, and true ultramarine blue finally became widely available. Across the Atlantic Ocean, colonial Baroque works created by artists like José Juárez, Baltasar de Echave Ibia and Cristóbal de Villalpando in early 17th Century Mexico – New Spain – were full of this beautiful blue. How could this be? Lapis lazuli was even rarer in the New World. It wasn’t until the middle of the 20th Century that archaeologists discovered the Maya had invented a resilient and brilliant blue, centuries before their land was colonised and their resources exploited.  - What connects Adam and Eve to Tinder  - The world’s most mysterious silver cups - How Van Gogh found Japan in Provence The ultramarine blue procured from lapis lazuli in Europe was not only incredibly expensive, but also extremely laborious to make. In Europe, blue was reserved for the most important subject matter. Rubens' Adoration of the Magi – the version that hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid and which he worked on for over 20 years – is an example. The colour was primarily used to paint the robes of the Virgin Mary, and later extended to include other royalty and holy figures. In Mexico, on the other hand, blue was used to paint altogether less holy and everyday subjects. Archaeologists studying pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican ruins were surprised by the discovery of blue murals in the Maya Riviera, modern day Mexico and Guatemala, from as early as 300 AD, perhaps the most famous being the murals at the temple of Chichén Itzá (created around 450 AD). The colour had a special ceremonial significance for the Maya. They covered sacrificial victims and the altars on which they were offered in a brilliant blue paint, writes Diego de Landa Calderón, a bishop in colonial Mexico during the 16th Century, in his first-hand account. Archaeologists were puzzled by the resilience of the blue in the murals. The añil plant, part of the indigo family, was widely available in the region but was mostly used for dyes rather than paint. Indigo was quick to fade in the sunlight and natural elements, so experts mused that the Maya couldn’t have used the same widely available dye to paint the murals. It wasn’t until the late 1960s that the source of Maya blue’s resilience through the centuries was discovered: a rare clay called attapulgite, which was mixed with the dye from the añil plant. During colonisation native materials like Maya blue and cochineal were exploited along with every other resource of the land and its people in the New World. These colours, which supposedly represented the wealth of the Maya empire, would stand as a symbol of all that would be plundered. Rhapsody in blue Master painters from the Americas are discussed in art history – if they’re mentioned at all – as a lesser school of Baroque compared to Caravaggio and Rubens. It's overly simplistic to assume that these Baroque masters were only impersonating their European predecessors. In fact, second and third generation painters born in Mexico City, such as Juárez and Echave Ibia, departed from European aesthetics, but arrived to something uniquely layered: enormous and sophisticated compositions that drew upon the full vibrancy of the New World. At Mexico’s National Art Museum (Munal) in Mexico City, works by Juárez seen chronologically show his development from a European impersonator to a New Spanish Baroque master. His early canvases departed from the dramatic spotlighting and warmth of European Baroque imagery and later moved into cold saturation throughout the picture plane (vibrant blues, yellows, greens and reds), multiple light sources, collaged compositions and grand scale – and in part because the use of local materials, such as Maya blue, expanded his palette. While Rubens also used vibrant colours, his compositions, on the whole, were more chaotic and warmer than those of Juárez. His pallet was even more vibrant than Rubens’, perhaps the most vibrant of the European Baroques, but his compositions were more akin to Caravaggio. Caravaggio's canvases were, without fail, full of rich reds and yellows, but nearly devoid of blue – if you think of a Caravaggio masterpiece, blue is usually absent. The closest to a blue-tinted Caravaggio you can find is Juárez’s work, but, despite his prolific reach and realised compositions, Juárez died in poverty.  If Juárez died without a peso to his name, how would he have had the resources to order large quantities of precious lapis lazuli from Europe? On the other hand, Villalpando, often said to be the most prolific colonial painter in New Spain, imitated the chaotic compositions by Rubens. Villalpando fits more neatly into the European history of Baroque painting and didn't depart from Rubens' ‘fear of space’ – the Baroque notion that every space of the canvas must crammed with imagery and incident – thus he was accepted by the canon of art history as the mascot of Novohispanic Baroque painting. Still, as much as he wanted to imitate Rubens, Villalpando painted with Mesoamerican materials and labour. The consistent result – the same as his peers in Mexico – was that his paintings and murals were cooler and more saturated. His mural adorning the dome of Puebla's cathedral was the first and only of its kind in New Spain. Swirling blue and purple clouds back the images of the virgin, the saints and the angels painted by Villalpando. Even though he sought to make European Baroque in the Americas, his materials gave him away as a criollo, a non-mixed-race descendant of the original Spanish settlers, from Mexico City. Baltasar de Echave Ibia painted such elaborate blues that he became known as ‘El Echave de los azules’ (the Echave of the blues). His father, Baltasar de Echave Orio, also used blue generously, but Echave Ibia was especially famous for his copious use and mastery of the colour. There is a reason why Ibia, working in Mexico City between the 17th and 18th Centuries, had access to seemingly limitless amounts of blue. All three had had sources of the brilliant colour closer to home. The lack of written evidence of the use of añil or Maya blue in Novohispanic Baroque paintings is made up for with visual evidence. From these painters and others in the colonised Americas it's apparent that Baroque artists in the New World weren’t using the same blue pigment as their European peers. The lapis lazuli blue being used in Europe was a dark ultramarine blue. While the blue being used in New Spain reflected the vivid azure, originally extracted from añil by the Maya. Maya blue is one of the most durable of all Mesoamerican colours, as seen in the 1,600-year-old murals at Chichén Itzá. Perhaps the same resistance to time has kept Baroque canvases and murals in the Americas, from Mexico to Peru, bright through the centuries. This cross-pollination of influences, from Maya to European Baroque, happening in Latin America on the canvases of criollo painters suggests globalism began much sooner than academic history has led us to believe.

        "headline": "The colour that means both life and death",
        "author": "Kelly Grovier",

        "content": "Green has symbolised both decay and regeneration, offering a bridge between this world and the next, writes Kelly Grovier. Beware of green. It can’t be trusted. Leonardo da Vinci knew, and cautioned his contemporaries against the pigment’s toxic instability. Its beauty, Leonardo warned, “vanishes into thin air”. Volatile and evanescent, green is more than just a colour. It is the energy that connects us to the unknown. Remove green from the palette of art history and a bridge between life and death would disappear. Equal parts morbid and vital, green curdles the cadaverous cheeks of Pablo Picasso’s macabre portrait of his young friend, Carlos Casagemas, who shot himself dead in lovelorn torment at the age of 20, while at the same time ignites with joyous chlorophyllic fire the life-affirming and ever-verdant canvases of Claude Monet. More like this: -       The insect that painted Europe red -       The toxic colour that comes from volcanoes -       The racist message hidden in a masterpiece To dabble in green is not merely to tread a path between being and unbeing, but to make inroads into the mysteries of each. Simultaneously the colour of putrefaction and of verdurous regeneration, green participates with unbiased vividity in decay and rebirth. Perhaps it is green’s teasing ambiguity that compelled Leonardo himself, against his own better counsel, to clad his most famous and enigmatic subject, the Mona Lisa, in a darkening shade of that colour – one that has since bruised itself to a sublime and submarine blackness in the subconscious of cultural history. Donning the deepest of shadowy green costumes, La Gioconda night-swims in the vitrine of our psyche and has long been recognised as a mystical commuter between the world of the living and that of the dead. “Like the vampire,” the 19th-Century English essayist Walter Pater once wrote of her, “she has been dead many times and learned the secrets of the grave”. Describing Leonardo’s inscrutable sitter as “older than the rocks among which she sits”, Pater proceeds to imagine that Mona Lisa has, throughout history, returned again and again as everything from “a diver in deep seas” to a savvy operator who has woven “strange webs with Eastern merchants”. Ceaselessly resurgent in her murky green gown, which symbolised her status as a merchant’s wife, Mona, according to Pater, was “the mother of Helen of Troy” and the “mother Mary”. Long before Leonardo reached for green, the colour had been assigned a special esoteric place in cultural imagination. Ancient Egyptians reserved green for the bold beryl complexion of their god of life and death, Osiris – ruler of the underworld, who held dominion over the passage of souls between this world and the next. Typical depictions of Osiris, such as one found on the 13th-Century BC walls of the burial tomb of Horemheb, the last monarch of the 18th dynasty of Egypt, portray a skinny, grassy-skinned god, whose false pharaoh’s beard marks him out as a deity of incontestable pre-eminence. Perennially young, Osiris was believed to be a serial resuscitator, both of himself and of the natural world. Holding sway over the flow of floods and flourishing of flora alike, leafy-cheeked Osiris, it was believed, would eventually show the souls of Egypt’s kings the path to resurrection. Flora and fauna For millennia, concocting green pigments was achieved by a variety of artistic alchemies that harnessed the hues of everything from pulverised malachite to the juice of buckthorn berries, from dessicated foxgloves and fraxinus leaves, to soaking yellow saffron in the purple dye of woad, also known as the ‘The Asp of Jerusalem’. Verdigris, among the more common iterations of the colour, and the one of which Leonardo was most wary, is forged in a curious ritual that involves the slow sousing in wine of a brass or copper blade. An acetic crust of green that scabs to the metallic surface is then scraped clean and ground into pigment. It was a green ghost of similar chemical contrivance that confirmed to scientists digging recently for the remains of the 16th-Century Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe that they had indeed found their target. Known to have worn a prosthetic nose to replace the one he’d lost in a sword fight in 1566, Brahe’s aesthetic skull bore traces of copper and zinc when, like a disciple of Osiris, it eventually came up for air in 2012. Fertile with life, even in death, the invocation of green in countless masterpieces from antiquity to the present day impregnates our eye with expectancy. Everything about the physique, posture and gestures of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini’s green-enrobed wife, who seems to rest her tired hand tenderly on her tummy’s bump in Jan van Eyck’s famous painting, The Arnolfini Portrait (painted in 1434), leads our modern mind to suspect that she is pregnant, however convinced art historians may be that she isn’t. The great gush of cascading green that capsizes our eye, scholars contend, is more likely a symbol of hope for the eventual blessing of children. Green springs eternal. An alternative reading of the riddling portrait only amplifies the eeriness of green’s potential to wed the living and the dead. According to one theory, the depiction of the woman in Van Eyck’s work is herself a composite double-portrait of two successive wives of Giovanni di Nicolao – his first having died in childbirth. Supporters of this view point to tropes of death that haunt the painting, such as the extinguished wick on the candle above her. Certainly the complex convex mirror, bolted to the back of the painting, which warps the couple’s reflection as if into a different continuum of reality, compounds the sense of strangely splitting selves that reverberate from the painting. If ever there was a colour capable of cloaking such a curious compression of life and death, it’s green. So green goes, sowing into the story of art the mysteries of our own fleeting appearance in the world. The murky green water that laps against the ochre edge of the River Stour in John Constable’s famous Romantic landscape The Hay Wain, delineates a boundary between the world that the artist can see in the here-and-now and one that haunts his imagination from childhood. Look closer at the weave of summer greenness at which the little dog in the foreground appears to pant, and you can barely discern the ghost of a horseman and barrel that the artist had once intended to include in the painting – a spectre that, over time, is re-sculpting itself from the verdurous summer air that Constable has mystically conjured. Though rightly celebrated for the accuracy of his carefully observed clouds, Constable is a master too of earthy hues and terrestrial textures. The tapestry of greens he weaves in The Hay Wain is a tour de force of that colour’s ability to convey the vibrancy of nostalgia for a place that ceaselessly shifts in one’s memory between wilting loss and luminous revelation. Hiding in plain sight In more recent eras of artistic expression, green has continued to be an enigmatic hue that hides as much as it reveals. Paul Gauguin’s seminal symbolist painting Green Christ (1889) is a teasing tangle of the colour’s contradictory connotations. Over a stone statue of the deceased Christ in the middle distance of the painting, a lucent layer of moss has stitched itself like a second skin. The face of a Breton woman, who stands in the shadow of that sculpture, is tinged a sepulchral green, as if she were slowly turning into the life-in-death and death-in-life statue – as if a kind of chromatic continuum exists between the physical world she inhabits and a mystical one that lies beyond. Belgian surrealist painter René Magritte’s famous anti-self-portrait, The Son of Man (1964), defies the logic of likenesses by refusing to let the viewer see the key features of the artist’s face by interposing between them and us the greenest of green apples the mind is capable of picturing. “Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see,” Magritte observed to an interviewer. “There is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of quite an intense feeling, a sort of conflict one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present.” No contemporary artist has understood more profoundly the rhythms of the visible that is not there and the visible that is, than the Irish-American abstract painter Sean Scully. The bold vertical columns of Scully’s The Bather (1983), inspired by Henri Matisse’s Bathers by a River, painted 70 years earlier, are stripped-down stand-ins for the already over-stylised bodies Scully recalls from Matisse’s work. Intensified by the boxy protrusions that complicate the carpentry of Scully’s work, which physically intrudes into the gallery-goer’s space, the ficus greens of Scully’s torso-wide trunks have succeeded in achieving an effect to which centuries of artists have only aspired: converting green from perishable colour into purest feeling.

        "content": "A hue now associated with innocence once had a murkier meaning: Kelly Grovier looks at the ways in which pink has represented violence and seduction. Pink is a double-edged sword. While red is raucous and racy, and white is prim and pure, pink cuts both ways. Long before the word “pink” attached itself to the pretty pastel shade of delicate carnations, as we define the term today, the London underworld enlisted it for something rather less frilly or fragrant – to denote the act of stabbing someone with a sharp blade. “He pink’d his Dubblet”, so reads an entry for the word in a 17th-Century dictionary of street slang used by “Beggars, Shoplifters, Highwaymen, Foot-Pads and all other Clans of Cheats and Villains”, describing a lethal lunge through a man’s padded jacket, “He run him through”. More like this: -       The insect that painted Europe red -       The toxic colour that comes from volcanoes -       The racist message hidden in a masterpiece At what point the unlikely linguistic slide was made from mortal piercing to mellow pigment, no one can say for sure. But the enticing hue itself, by whatever name it was known before the assignment of “pink” to the colour chart in the 18th Century, has kept culture blushing since antiquity. Now seductive, now innocent, pink is coquettish and coy, sultry and sly. Remove pink from the palette of art history and a teasing dimension to the story of image-making would be lost. Edgar Degas’s Pink Dancers would fall flat-footed and Pablo Picasso’s pivotal pink period wouldn’t rise to the occasion. A flesh in the pan A key moment in pink’s emergence as an essential element in the development of painting is the creation by the Early Renaissance Italian painter Fra Angelico in the middle of the 15th Century of his famous fresco in the Convent of San Marco in Florence, Italy, The Annunciation, which depicts the moment in the New Testament that the Virgin Mary is informed by the Archangel Gabriel that she will become the mother of Christ. Situated at the top of a staircase solemnly ascended daily by pious monks, Fra Angelico’s ground-breaking painting is one into which an observer’s spirit is summoned to levitate. Crucial to sparking that mystical lift-off in the fresco is the portrayal of the ethereal Archangel – who has himself mystically crossed planes of being to swoop into Mary’s material sphere. Never mind the polychromatic wings, what’s most surprising about Gabriel’s depiction is Fra Angelico’s decision to clad him in plush pleats of sumptuous pink. We know from a contemporary artist’s handbook on how to concoct pigments (Cennino Ceninni’s Il libro dell'arte, published a few decades before Fra Angelico painted his fresco) that pink had been traditionally reserved primarily for the rendering of flesh. “Made from the loveliest and lightest sinopia that is found and is mixed and mulled with St. John’s white”, Cennini explains, “this pigment does you great credit if you use it for painting faces, hands and nudes on walls”. By draping Gabriel in the lushest of pinks, Fra Angelico fleshes the Archangel out as a being of body and blood, breaking down the distinction between holy spirit and ephemeral flesh. Pink is the pivot that humanises heaven. No one would ever see the colour the same way again. In the ensuing centuries, artists would invoke pink as shorthand for the blurring of boundaries. Bloom of Christ As the focus of Renaissance master Raphael’s Madonna of the Pinks, a sprig of blushing carnations handed to the Virgin Mary by the infant Christ, may seem unremarkable enough at first glance. In fact it amounts to a kind of miraculous wrinkle in the fabric of time. According to religious tradition, dianthus (the Greek name for the plant, meaning “flower of God”), did not appear in the world until Mary wept at her son’s crucifixion. The flower’s anachronistic appearance in Raphael’s scene, therefore, tinged with the future blood of the baby who holds it, mysteriously establishes a pink kink in the linear unfolding of the universe. Over time, pink would eventually blossom beyond the petals of its complex theologies to inflect a wider array of secular personality, all the while retaining its elusive allure and capacity to tease. By the 18th Century, pink was offering itself as the colour of choice for portraying high-profile mistresses, daring observers to deny its very legitimacy as a respectable hue. Famous portraits by the French Rococo portraitist Maurice Quentin de la Tour of Madame de Pompadour and by the English artist George Romney of his muse Emma, Lady Hamilton (later mistress of Lord Nelson), posing as a mythological maenad, reveal how decidedly deconsecrated the colour had become. La Tour’s full-length pastel-pencil portrait of the official chief mistress to Louis XV of France, begun around 1748, is a rumbunctious jungle gym of superfluous pinks that spider across every inch and threaten to suffocate its subject. Here, pink is an energy that vibrates from the sitter to the secular subjects with which Pompadour has surrounded herself – music, astronomy, and literature. Porcelain pink A patron of the porcelain trade, Pompadour had famously inspired the minting by the Sevres porcelain factory of a new hue of pink, delicately bruised by dabs of blue and black. To Pompadour, pink was no longer a mere accessory but a partner in crime – an aspirational second skin into which she grew intellectually and emotionally. She became her colour. No painting embodies pink’s gradual pendulum movement from the spiritual to the secular more vividly than the French artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s exuberant The Swing, painted around 1767, between La Tour’s and Romney’s works. Here, a fabulous flounce of flowing rose is frozen in mid swivel as the swinging girl, pillowed in pinkness, flicks loose a silk shoe, attracting the titillated attention of any number of camouflaged male gazes hiding in the bushes around her. We’re a long way from the pink whisper of angels now. In more recent times, pink continues to be seized upon by artists keen to confound our expectations of what notes or message the floral pigment can confidently carry. Having established a formidable reputation in the middle of the 20th Century as a first-generation Abstract Expressionist, eschewing figurative subjects entirely in the 1950s, Canadian-born American artist Philip Guston reached for pink in a dramatic turn back to representational art in the late 1960s. By then, the colour itself had undergone something of a commercial transformation in American retail culture, having begun the century as a shade more often associated with boys and masculinity than fairy princesses and little girls’ dolls. But by the time Guston began introducing a menacing cast of Ku Klux Klan-inspired cartoon goons, whose implausibly pale pink stubby hoods continue to menace popular imagination to this day, the colour had been re-commodified as delicate and feminine. Grabbing pink by the scruff for his unsettling scenes of a seedy Americana, Guston slaps Barbie across the chops. At the same moment that Guston’s provocative pink was poking the art world in the eye, scientific studies were underway by Alexander Schauss, Director of the American Institute for Biosocial Research, to determine whether manipulations of the colour could help control the behaviour of subjects surrounded by it. The result of Schauss’s investigation was the concoction of the psychologically subtle shade now known as “Baker-Miller Pink”, after the Naval correctional institute in Seattle, Washington where the pigment was successfully tested on the walls of inmates’ cells and credited with a significant calming of aggressive urges. Yet despite its ability to inspire docility, pink is still picking fights, challenging our perceptions to an aesthetic duel. Upon learning that the British artist Anish Kapoor had signed a contract giving him exclusive rights to a recently engineered colour known as Vantablack (the darkest shade ever devised), and the legal right to prohibit other artists from doing so, Kapoor’s younger contemporary Stuart Semple saw red. Emboldened by Kapoor’s black embargo, Semple began concocting a supremely-fluorescent pink paint he contends is the “pinkest pink” ever contemplated (“no one has ever seen a pinker pink”, he insists). As a poke in the eye of Kapoor, Semple has made his colour available at a small price to anyone in the world so long as they confirm that they are not Anish Kapoor nor friendly enough with Kapoor to share it with him. En garde, Kapoor. You’ve been pink’d. If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

        "content": "For centuries, the orange pigment was sourced from a toxic mineral. Kelly Grovier looks at a hue that alchemists believed was crucial to creating the Philosopher’s Stone – and which allows art to swivel between different states of being. Expunge orange from the history of art and the whole thing collapses. The sky above Edvard Munch’s The Scream falls down and the fire that ignites Frederic Leighton’s famous Flaming June flames out. Take away orange, and everything from the warm eternal glow of Egyptian tomb painting to the troubled stubble of Vincent van Gogh’s smouldering self-portraits vanishes. A savvy arbiter between resolute red and unyielding yellow, orange is a pigment that pivots. It’s a hinge of a hue that enables a work of art to swivel between contrary states of being – this world and another, life and death. Outside the frame of art history, orange has proved an unusually elastic symbol, blossoming into a spectrum of shapes and cultural meanings. Although the influential European royal House of Orange traces its name back further than the actual coining of the colour in the 1540s, its prominent son, William III (better known as William of Orange), quickly embraced the linguistic coincidence in the 1570s. His orange-white-and-blue rebel flag would become the forerunner of the modern tricolour of The Netherlands. From there orange took on the complexion of everything from Swiss fire engines to the suits worn by astronauts in the International Space Station. But it’s in the realms of art and aesthetics that the colour has fructified more soulfully. From antiquity to the end of the 19th Century, a volcanic mineral found in sulphurous fumaroles (great gashes in the Earth’s crust) was a significant source for the harvesting of orange pigment. The highly toxic orpiment, rich in lethal arsenic, ripens from mellow yellow into outrageous orange when subjected to the heat of a fire. Convinced that the luminous shimmer of orpiment (its name is a contraction of Latin aurum, meaning ‘gold’, and pigmentum meaning ‘colour’) must be a key ingredient in concocting the Philosopher’s Stone, alchemists for centuries risked exposure to the noxious substance. So did artists. To dabble in the occult of orange was to flirt with mortality and immortality in equal measure. A spark to a flame Intentionally or not, that ambiguous aura is irrepressible wherever orange is conjured in art. Take for example the French Rococo painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s portrait of a generic writer captured at a moment of intense vision: Inspiration, painted around 1769. The poet’s plush orange jacket – its vibrant rumples flickering like flares – threatens to engulf the allegorical subject of a poet whose imagination has just been ignited. The furrowed velour has become an outward reflection of the writer’s mind. This evaporative moment of reverie that illuminates the subject, as if from inside his soul, will either ensure his eternal fame as a celebrated bard or will set on fire his very being. Fashion him in any other colour than orange and the work’s flustering power would be utterly lost. Nor is it possible to imagine Self-portrait with Halo and Snake, painted by the post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin more than a century after Fragonard’s canvas, soaked in any other colours than the two competing complexions of orange that dominate and divide its radiant surface into competing territories of piousness and malevolence. Created by Gauguin while living in the North-western French fishing village of Le Pouldu, the work portrays, in its upper half, a saintly indifference to worldly temptations, as symbolised by a dangling sprig of forbidden fruit. To make certain we don’t miss the unmissable point, the artist has crowned himself in this hemisphere of the work with an angelic halo. The lower half of the wood panel, however, reveals an uncontainable susceptibility to evil as the seductive snake from the Garden of Eden has the artist wrapped around his proverbial finger. Tying the work together tonally is a dramatic shift at its equator in shades of orange – not unlike orpiment itself, before and after its purifying baptism by fire. And so it goes, work by work, century after century: wherever the colour orange dictates the temperature of a work of art, we know we’ve arrived at a precarious hinterland between a universe we can see and a mysterious unknown we tentatively feel. How else can you characterise the realm in which the liquified face of Munch’s hero howls under a strange and estranging burnt-cinnamon sky in The Scream? How else can you describe the eternal space in which Henri Matisse’s iconic The Dance whirls apocalyptically on the edge of oblivion? Commissioned in 1909 by a wealthy Russian businessman to adorn the staircase of his mansion, at first glance The Dance might appear the apotheosis of rhythmic delight and synchronised levity. But the eerie apricot tinge of the five ecstatic nudes, who seem to have subsumed into their very being the armageddon orange of Munch’s work, is a tip-off that something more complex and perilous is at play. The two dancers who stretch the foreground of the work have lost their grip on each other’s hands, as the one closest to us begins slipping to the ground. Her left foot is already sliding out of view. Far from depicting untroubled joy, Matisse’s carefully choreographed masterpiece teeters on cosmic disaster. The very rotation of the world is left dangerously in doubt. Amber alert Munch and Matisse set the tone, as it were, for the portentous temperament of orange in modern and contemporary art. Throughout the 20th Century, the ominous refulgence of orange will find itself refracted variously in the works of everyone from Francis Bacon, where it sets the sinister scene for the disturbing Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (1944), as well as Rene Magritte’s Art of Living (1967), where the colour inflates itself to popping point as a surreal cranium. The syncopated pigments and shudders of Rhythm, joy of life, painted in 1931, is characteristic of how crucial orange is to the work and imagination of the Ukrainian-born French artist Sonia Delauney, who once protested: “You know I don’t like orange”. Like it or not, orange is frequently the heat that holds together – while threatening to break apart – the visual music of her sinuous mosaics. As crucial as orange has been to the story of art through the end of the last century, it has already dyed itself indelibly into the unfolding fabric of contemporary artistic consciousness. Among the most celebrated major works of the new millennium, The Gates, by Bulgarian artist Christo Yavacheff and French artist Jeanne-Claude (known together as Christo and Jeanne-Claude), colonised New York City’s Central Park in February 2005 with over 7,500 passageways – each flowing with orange nylon fabric. The lyrical succession of thresholds, which fostered a poetic sense of the endless comings and goings of life – birth and rebirth, mortality and eternity – could, on reflection, have only been draped in stirring saffron. To some, the colour echoes the robes of Buddhist monks. But to my mind, Christo and Jeanne-Claude (who passed away four years later) were rekindling a sacred flame, inviting those who would come to bask their weary souls in the transformative power of that most mystical of ancient tints: orange.

        "content": "Marcel Duchamp’s last painting has influenced artists for a century. Kelly Grovier looks at how it inspired the modern colour chart – and at its 17th-Century predecessor. This year marks the centenary of one of the more curious milestones in modern cultural history – a landmark in image-making with intriguing echoes of a long-forgotten tome from the 17th Century. In 1918, the French avant-garde artist Marcel Duchamp picked up his brush after a four-year hiatus from painting and created a mysterious work that changed forever the way artists use and understand colour. After completing his painting, Duchamp put his brush back down again and, for the next 50 years (until his death in 1968), never painted another picture. More like this: - When the Parthenon had dazzling colours - The insect that painted Europe red - The subversive power of the pipe The work in question is awkwardly proportioned – over 3m (9.4ft) long, yet barely two-thirds of a metre tall – and was commissioned to hang above a bookcase in the library of the US collector and patron of the arts Katherine Dreier. At first glance, the canvas (which Duchamp eccentrically entitled T um’, a terse abbreviation of the tetchy French phrase tu m’ennuies, or ‘you bore me’) appears to do everything it can to be something other than a painting. Its surface is dominated by shadowy allusions to a series of controversial sculptures that Duchamp had recently been making – found objects such as a hat rack, a corkscrew, and a bicycle wheel – that he christened ‘readymades’. In stark contrast to these large ghostly echoes of another artistic medium, a scatter of worldly debris is strewn across the painting: safety pins, a bolt, and a brush for cleaning bottles. According to Yale University, “Duchamp summarises different ways in which a work of art can suggest reality: as shadow, imitation, or actual object.” Stretching over this odd array of forms is a carefully-rendered cascade of colourful lozenge-shaped tiles that swoop vibrantly into the centre of the painting from the top left, like the tail of a mechanical polychromatic comet. Anyone who has ever shopped in a DIY store for domestic paint will recognise immediately this splay of colour tiles. But in 1918, pigment samples from commercial colour charts were still relatively cutting-edge in their retail trendiness, having only hit shop floors towards the end of the previous century. As yet unassigned to an actual object, these ‘readymade’ swatches of colour are at once both physical and theoretical; they haver between the real world of things waiting to be painted and a realm of pure mind in which those things can still be any colour. A pigment of our imagination In a sense, this endless deck of dyes bursting into the middle of Duchamp’s painting is a Tarot of tincture, prescient of how things could eventually appear in an ideal world, not as they actually are. Though Duchamp’s tiles are merely a prophecy of hue, they seem somehow more real and urgent in his painting than the shadowy shapes of the hat stand, bicycle wheel, and corkscrew whose space they intersect cosmically, as if from another universe. The years and decades that followed Duchamp’s final painting witnessed a succession of works by modern and contemporary artists that wrestle with and absorb the implications of his mischievous slicing of the mere idea of colour from the fact of physical form. Where proponents of colour theories of the 19th Century, such as those by the German Romantic Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and by the French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul, are concerned with how colours are perceived by the human retina, the disciples of Duchamp became obsessed instead with colour as a commercialised concept – a pigment of their imagination. At the same moment that descendants of post-Impressionism and the early pioneers of Expressionism were formulating quasi-scientific manifestos for how colour functions in the eyes of those who encounter their work, Duchamp was laying his new-fangled cards on the table: colour is an aspirational commodity – a property to be found, not an emotion to be felt. Titians of industry Suddenly, two philosophies of colour found themselves competing for artistic regard – one that understood it as a traditional tool of the craftsman to be soulfully mastered, the other that saw it as an artificial aspect of soullessly manufactured goods. That clash of sensibilities was perhaps most dramatically illustrated by the near-simultaneous appearance in 1963 of two very different kinds of publication. It was the year that the German-born American artist Josef Albers released his still-influential visual treatise, Interaction of Colour, which provides complex ruminations on the harmony of hues – a system that continues to be taught to this day. It is also the year that Pantone published its encyclopaedic compendium of subtle shades – a volume that appeared to prove the dominion of industry over the empire of conceivable colours. The sway over artistic imagination in the 20th Century of the Pantone colour-matching system, and its precursors in the pigment charts distributed by companies such as DuPont, is impossible to overstate. Their influence can be traced in the works of generations of artists from Andy Warhol to Damien Hirst, Ellsworth Kelly to Gerhard Richter. But if Duchamp’s echelon of mechanical colour stretches prophetically forward in time to the obsessions of everyone from the Pop Artists to the YBAs, it also stretches back in history to the preoccupations of one of the most extraordinary, and extraordinarily neglected, books ever created. Long forgotten until its rediscovery in recent years by Medieval and Renaissance scholars, Klaer lightende Spiegel der Verfkonst is an 800-page handwritten and hand-illustrated volume from 1692 that seeks not only to illustrate every conceivable shade of watercolour possible, but to explain how to create them. An obsessive-compulsive recipe book for concocting the subtlest variations of tint, the book is the brainchild, according to the title page, of ‘A. Boogert’ – a Dutch hustler of hues about whom nothing else is known. Boogert’s book, which the inscrutable author says was intended to assist artists, came to the attention by accident of a Dutch Medievalist and blogger who was conducting research on the online databases of the Bibliothèque Méjanes in Aix-en-Provence, France, in 2014. Erik Kwakkel’s decision to feature the vibrant volume on his popular scholarly blog, and to provide links to a high-resolution scan of the entire book, helped propel the lexicon of luminosity into wider recognition than the single-surviving copy could ever have enjoyed in the author’s own lifetime. To click through the digitised pages of the book and watch the hundreds of abutting tiles flick into a shuffled blur of calibrated colour is to find oneself enacting the geometric drama of Duchamp’s pivotal final painting. Speaking to each other across centuries, Boogert’s long-lost opus maximum and Duchamp’s underappreciated prophetic masterpiece reveal a perennial fascination with the mysterious disguises of life’s most elusive dimension: colour.

        "content": "Truly vibrant red was elusive for many years: until a mysterious dye was discovered in Mexico. Devon Van Houten Maldonado reveals how a crushed bug became a sign of wealth and status. Although scarlet is the colour of sin in the Old Testament, the ancient world’s elite was thirsty for red, a symbol of wealth and status. They spent fantastic sums searching for ever more vibrant hues, until Hernán Cortés and the conquistadors discovered an intoxicatingly saturated pigment in the great markets of Tenochtitlan, modern-day Mexico City. Made from the crushed-up cochineal insect, the mysterious dye launched Spain toward its eventual role as an economic superpower and became one of the New World’s primary exports, as a red craze descended on Europe. An exhibition at Mexico City’s Palacio de Bellas Artes museum reveals the far-reaching impact of the pigment through art history, from the renaissance to modernism. In medieval and classical Europe, artisans and traders tripped over each other in search of durable saturated colors and – in turn – wealth, amid swathes of weak and watery fabrics. Dyers guilds guarded their secrets closely and performed seemingly magical feats of alchemy to fix colours to wool, silk and cotton. They used roots and resins to create satisfactory yellows, greens and blues. The murex snail was crushed into a dye to create imperial purple cloth worth more than its weight in gold. But truly vibrant red remained elusive. For many years, the most common red in Europe came from the Ottoman Empire, where the ‘Turkey red’ process used the root of the rubia plant. European dyers tried desperately to reproduce the results from the East, but succeeded only partially, as the Ottoman process took months and involved a pestilent mix of cow dung, rancid olive oil and bullocks’ blood, according to Amy Butler Greenfield in her book, A Perfect Red. Dyers also used Brazilwood, lac and lichens, but the resulting colours were usually underwhelming, and the processes often resulted in brownish or orange reds that faded quickly. For royalty and elite, St John’s Blood and Armenian red (dating back as far as the 8th Century BCE, according to Butler Greenfield), created the most vibrant saturated reds available in Europe until the 16th Century. But, made from different varieties of Porphyrophora root parasites, their production was laborious and availability was scarce, even at the highest prices. Mesoamerican peoples in southern Mexico had started using the cochineal bug as early as 2000 BCE, long before the arrival of the conquistadors, according to Mexican textile expert Quetzalina Sanchez. Indigenous people in Puebla, Tlaxcala and Oaxaca had systems for breeding and engineering the cochineal bugs for ideal traits and the pigment was used to create paints for codices and murals, to dye cloth and feathers, and even as medicine. Cochineal in the New World When the conquistadors arrived in Mexico City, the headquarters of the Aztec empire, the red colour was everywhere. Outlying villages paid dues to their Aztec rulers in kilos of cochineal and rolls of blood-red cloth. “Scarlet is the colour of blood and the grana from cochineal achieved that [...] the colour always had a meaning, sometimes magic other times religious,” Sanchez told the BBC. Cortés immediately recognized the riches of Mexico, which he related in several letters to King Charles V. “I shall speak of some of the things I have seen, which although badly described, I know very well will cause such wonder that they will hardly be believed, because even we who see them here with our own eyes are unable to comprehend their reality,” wrote Cortés to the king. About the great marketplace of Tenochtitlan, which was “twice as large as that of Salamanca,\" he wrote, “They also sell skeins of different kinds of spun cotton in all colours, so that it seems quite like one of the silk markets of Granada, although it is on a greater scale; also as many different colours for painters as can be found in Spain and of as excellent hues.” First-hand accounts indicate that Cortés wasn’t overly smitten with cochineal, more concerned instead with plundering gold and silver. Back in Spain, the king was pressed to make ends meet and hold together his enormous dominion in relative peace, so, although he was at first unconvinced by the promise of America, he became fascinated by the exotic tales and saw in cochineal an opportunity to prop up the crown’s coffers. By 1523, cochineal pigment made its way back to Spain and caught the attention of the king who wrote to Cortés about exporting the dyestuff back to Europe, writes Butler. “Through absurd laws and decrees [the Spanish] monopolised the grana trade,” says Sanchez. “They obligated the indians to produce as much as possible.” The native Mesoamericans who specialised in the production of the pigment and weren’t killed by disease or slaughtered during the conquest were paid pennies on the dollar – while the Spaniards “profited enormously as intermediaries.” Red in art history Dye from the cochineal bug was ten times as potent as St John’s Blood and produced 30 times more dye per ounce than Armenian red, according to Butler. So when European dyers began to experiment with the pigment, they were delighted by its potential. Most importantly, it was the brightest and most saturated red they had ever seen. By the middle of the 16th Century it was being used across Europe, and by the 1570s it had become one of the most profitable trades in Europe – growing from a meagre “50,000 pounds of cochineal in 1557 to over 150,000 pounds in 1574,” writes Butler. In the Mexican Red exhibition at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the introduction of cochineal red to the European palette is illustrated in baroque paintings from the beginning of the 17th Century, after the pigment was already a booming industry across Europe and the world. Works by baroque painters like Cristóbal de Villalpando and Luis Juárez, father of José Juárez, who worked their entire lives in Mexico (New Spain), hang alongside the Spanish-born Sebastián López de Arteaga and the likes of Peter Paul Rubens. López de Arteaga’s undated work The Incredulity of Saint Thomas pales in comparison to Caravaggio’s version of the same work, where St Thomas’s consternation and amazement is palpable in the skin of his furrowed forehead. But the red smock worn by Christ in López de Arteaga’s painting, denoting his holiness, absolutely pops off the canvas. Both artists employed cochineal, the introduction of which helped to establish the dramatic contrast that characterised the baroque style. A few steps away, a portrait of Isabella Brandt (1610) by Rubens shows the versatility of paint made from cochineal. The wall behind the woman is depicted in a deep, glowing red, from which she emerges within a slight aura of light. The bible in her hand was also rendered in exquisite detail from cochineal red in Rubens’ unmistakable mastery of his brush, which makes his subjects feel as alive as if they were in front of you. Moving forward toward modernism – it wasn’t until the middle of the 19th Century that cochineal was replaced by synthetic alternatives as the pre-eminent red dyestuff in the world – impressionist painters continued to make use of the heavenly red hues imported from Mexico. At the Palacio de Bellas Artes, works by Paul Gauguin, Auguste Renoir and Vincent van Gogh have all been analysed and tested positive for cochineal. Like Rubens, Renoir’s subjects seem to be alive on the canvas, but as an impressionist his portraits dissolved into energetic abstractions. Gauguin also used colour, especially red, to create playful accents, but neither compared to the saturation achieved by Van Gogh. His piece, The Bedroom (1888), on loan from the Art Institute of Chicago, puts a full stop on the exhibition with a single burning-hot spot of bright red. After synthetic pigments became popular, outside of Mexico, the red dye was mass-produced as industrial food colouring – its main use today. Yet while the newly independent Mexico no longer controlled the valuable monopoly on cochineal, it also got something back – the sacred red that had been plundered and proliferated by the Spanish. “In Europe, as has happened in many cases, the history of the original people of Mexico has mattered very little,” Sanchez told the BBC, but in Mexico “the colour continues to be associated with ancestral magic [and] protects those who wear attire dyed with cochineal.” If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

        "headline": "'An unmistakable stab at the USSR': Could Amadeus be the most misunderstood Oscar winner ever?",
        "author": "Tom Joudrey",
        "published_date": "28 September 2024",
        "summary": "Released 40 years ago this month, Miloš Forman's best picture-winning Amadeus is often accused of historical inaccuracies – but the film's critics could be missing the point.",
        "content": "Released 40 years ago this month, Miloš Forman's best picture-winning Amadeus is often accused of historical inaccuracies – but the film's critics could be missing the point. When it premiered 40 years ago, Amadeus drew an initial wave of praise. A historical drama revolving around the rivalry between two composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri, it went on to win eight Oscars, including for best picture. Miloš Forman took home the best director prize, Peter Shaffer won for best adapted screenplay and both of the lead actors were nominated: F Murray Abraham, who played Salieri, beat Tom Hulce, who played Mozart. But in the years that followed, a backlash grew over what some people saw as Amadeus's litany of historical errors. An article in The Guardian declared that \"the fart jokes can't conceal how laughably wrong this is\", and the BBC commented that \"the film plays shamelessly fast and loose with historical fact\". Salieri, critics noted, was no pious bachelor (as attested by his wife, eight children and mistress), and it's after all an odd kind of hateful rivalry when the real Mozart entrusted the musical education of his own son to Salieri. As for Mozart's lewd humor, that cheeky insouciance was actually commonplace in middle-class Viennese society. Most egregiously of all, world-famous Mozart was not dumped in an unmarked pauper's grave. If this is a homage to history, the complaint goes, it's akin to Emperor Joseph II fumbling ineptly on the pianoforte and bungling every other note. But this kind of cavilling may be missing the point. Forman's aim for Amadeus can be seen as radically different from a typical biopic, and that was to use a fictionalised version of an epic clash between musical composers to allegorise the defining global rivalry of the mid-to-late 20th Century: the Cold War. Put simply, the film may have played fast and loose with 1784 because its real preoccupation was 1984. The film opens in Vienna in 1823. Grizzled court composer Salieri howls through a bolted chamber door that he has murdered Mozart, then slashes his own throat. Days later, as he convalesces in an asylum, a priest arrives to hear his confession. It doesn't disappoint. Salieri recounts that as boy he made a vow of chastity to God as an expression of gratitude for, as he sees it, ushering in the providential death of his father to clear the path for his musical development. Jump ahead some years, and Salieri is now an eminent composer in the court of Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), where he eagerly awaits an introduction to musical prodigy Mozart. That eagerness curdles when he sees the man in the flesh – he turns out to be a lascivious vulgarian with an ear-splitting cackle. Convinced that God means to mock his own mediocrity, Salieri hurls a crucifix in the fire and vows retaliation. When Mozart's father dies, Salieri seizes on the misfortune with a dastardly stratagem: dupe Mozart into believing that his father has risen from the grave to commission him to write a requiem, then murder him and pass off the masterpiece as his own. Mozart, feverish and besotted with drink, dies, leaving Salieri addled with bitterness and destined for obscurity. The premise wasn't original to Forman. Drawing inspiration from Alexander Pushkin's taut 1830 play Mozart and Salieri, Peter Shaffer wrote a highly stylised play called Amadeus, which premiered in London in 1979. Forman, sitting in on a preview, was entranced by the dramatic rivalry and convinced Shaffer to collaborate with him, not merely to adapt the play for the screen but to \"demolish the original, then totally reimagine it as a film\". Across four irascible months cloistered in a Connecticut farmhouse with Shaffer, Forman fundamentally rebuilt the narrative with a fresh palette of political resonances. The casting process for the coveted roles of Mozart and Salieri rivaled Gone with the Wind in scope and behind-the-scenes intrigue, all of which played out over a year and involved meetings with literally thousands of actors. Kenneth Branagh was nearly victorious in landing Mozart, then got dropped from consideration when Forman pivoted to a US cast. Mark Hamill endured grueling hours of auditions, only to be told by Forman: \"No one is believing that the Luke Skywalker is the Mozart.\" Al Pacino lobbied hard for the part of Salieri, in competition with Mick Jagger, Burt Reynolds, Donald Sutherland and Sam Waterson. In the end, Forman eschewed splashy celebrities for Hulce and Abraham, only to have casting drama explode again when Meg Tilly, slated to play Mozart's wife, Constanze, broke her ankle playing football: she was replaced by Elizabeth Berridge a week before shooting was to commence. With the plot rebuilt and the cast in place, more than one rivalry was poised to come into focus. The Czech-born Forman had been a galvanising force behind the Czechoslovakian New Wave film movement in the 1960s, reaching a climax with his 1967 film The Firemen's Ball, which satirised the absurd inefficiencies of Eastern European communism. The film was initially warmly received within the reformist milieu of the Prague Spring, but when Soviet tanks rolled into Prague the following year and organised Czechoslovakia into the Eastern bloc, Forman, tarred as a \"traitor\" to the state, was forced to flee to the West and found refuge in the US. Nearly all of Forman's film work thereafter would show glimmers of opposition to Soviet-style censorship, confinement, and concentrated power. His first success in the US, for example, 1975's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, depicted a mental health ward meting out cruelty and coercion to patients under the guise of benevolent care. Audiences barely needed to squint to see the asylum as gulag and Nurse Ratched as the embodiment of the drunk-on-power Soviet bureaucrat. Likewise, Forman's 1996 film, The People vs Larry Flynt, depicted the founder of Hustler magazine squaring off against censorship at the cost of being jailed, locked up at a psychiatric facility and paralysed by an assassin's bullet. The Soviet allegory can certainly be applied to Amadeus. Perhaps Forman was less concerned with hewing to biographical facts as he was with presenting Mozart as a beleaguered type of ecstatic genius who, hostage to patronage, is stifled and finally crushed by the repressive apparatus of the state. Joseph II, absolute ruler of the Habsburg monarchy, is advised at court by a clutch of prudish sycophants who undermine Mozart's achievements and smear his reputation. Whatever its loose correspondence to the late-18th and early-19th Centuries, this critique can be read as a stab at the USSR – a debilitatingly centralised bureaucracy hostile to insurgent ideas and innovation. But Forman showed that Mozart would get the last laugh. By the events of 1823, Salieri's insipid, state-sponsored melodies have all been forgotten, while a few bars of Mozart draw immediate joy to the priest's face. In the free market of popular tastes, Salieri's mandated drivel has been suffocated by the triumph of genius. In Forman's hands, the Habsburg Empire bears the hallmarks of Soviet power. The masquerade balls, with their bewildering swirl of masked identities, conjure the confusion and paranoia that proliferated under the Soviet system. Salieri's reluctant servant-spy (Cynthia Nixon) carries out covert surveillance, a nod to the 20th Century's KGB, which had thousands of its moles burrow into the private lives of artists and dissidents. Meanwhile, Salieri's heretical burning of the crucifix and war on God call to mind the ideological struggle between a Christian worldview and secular Soviet hubris. (After Abraham's mother – a pious Italian woman – saw the cross-burning scene, she browbeat her son so relentlessly that he blurted out what he now tells the BBC was a lie: \"I told her, 'mum, that was an extra – somebody else threw it in there!'\") And then there's the mass grave into which Mozart's corpse is dumped. This depiction does not fit the facts of what is known about his death, but it makes sense if read as an indictment of Soviet practices – the effacement of individual identity and literal mass murder. Grim excavations of these pits continue to this day. Forman, whose own parents perished in Nazi concentration camps, understood the power of this imagery. Jeff Smith, author of Film Criticism, the Cold War, and the Blacklist, tells the BBC that Mozart's struggle against the status quo tapped into Forman's own frustrations with Soviet censorship. \"The emperor's fatuous judgment about Mozart's opera – 'too many notes' – is just the kind of accusation that was used as a cudgel used against avant-garde artists and thinkers to imply their work isn't pleasant or edifying to Soviet ears. Mozart's enraged incredulity in that scene must have mirrored Forman's own longstanding contempt for Soviet stagnation and repression.\" Shooting took place in 1983 over a six-month period in Prague, which had the virtue of offering basilicas, palaces and cobblestone squares virtually unchanged since the late 18th Century. Even with Soviet power waning, however, Czechoslovakia remained part of the Eastern bloc and Forman was still persona non grata, so a deal was struck: the director would refrain from meeting with political dissidents, and the regime would allow friends of Forman to visit with their repatriated prodigal son. Forman's own recollections from the shoot centred on the travails of Soviet interference. His landlady warned his phone is bugged. Informers lurked in every room. Two unmarked cars tailed him everywhere, which seemed redundant since his own driver was also a secret agent. In his autobiography, Turnaround, Forman is just shy of explicit about the degree to which themes of Soviet repression leaked into Amadeus. \"As it had to be in the socialist Prague,\" he wrote, \"the spirit of Franz Kafka presided over our production\".  Perhaps even more telling is a story he recounts of negotiating with the general director of Czechoslovak film, Jiří Purš, who, as Forman recounted, wanted absolute assurance that the Communist Party would have nothing to fear: \"I assume that politically there is nothing in the script that they could hang their hats on?\" Forman's reply is a model of plausible deniability and acid irony: \"Look, it's about Mozart!\" More like this: • The cinema classic that made Clint Eastwood a star • The real California scandal that led to Chinatown • The D-day film that changed how we see war F Murray Abraham felt the strain of coercive scrutiny as he was traveling back and forth to the United States to shoot his role in Scarface (1983) while Amadeus was in production in Prague. Abraham tells the BBC, \"At the end of every shooting day I had to cross the border to get to the airport in Vienna to return to Hollywood. At the checkpoint, the Czechoslovak Police would make us sit idle at the gate, just as a way to throw their weight around, make you know who's in charge. That sense of bullying and intimidation was everywhere, and even when the Czech people responded with subversive humor, the strain was palpable. We never forgot for a minute that we were under communist surveillance.\" That tension between the US crew and Soviet agents finally burst out into the open on 4 July. The production was shooting an opera scene, and the crew arranged so that when Forman yelled \"action\" a US flag unfurled and the national anthem played in lieu of Mozart's music. Some 500 Czech extras burst forth into emotional song, in effect revealing their sympathies with the West. But not all of them. Forman recalled, \"All stood up – except 30 men and women, panic on their face, looking at each other [asking] what they should do. They were the secret police, dispersed among the extras.\" As Amadeus continues to be reassessed at its 40th anniversary, the significance of the Cold War looms ever larger. Paul Frazier, author of The Cold War on Film, tells the BBC that the film brilliantly tapped into a deep vein of Soviet envy: \"Salieri is the Soviet Lada trying to be a Ford Mustang. He can't be as great as Mozart, so he resorts to undermining and manipulating him. This too was the approach of the old USSR towards the West: rather than being better than the West, the Soviets resorted to undermining and discrediting the West at every turn.\" Historian Nicholas J Cull echoes that analysis. \"Think of the Jonathan Swift line: 'When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.' Whether it's the 1780s or 1980s, what you have is true genius facing off against mediocre, conniving bureaucrats. You see this same dynamic at play in a Cold War film like last summer's Oppenheimer, which in some ways is Amadeus with A-bombs. It makes sense that refugee film-makers like Forman and his creative team would be drawn to tell an allegory of communist mismanagement.\" Not everyone is sold on the idea that Amadeus wrestles with Soviet totalitarianism. Kevin Hagopian, a media studies professor at Penn State University, says there's a risk of allegorising everything as an unseen Soviet menace, which ends up making art a mere handmaid to politics. \"That ultimately becomes a depressingly narrow way to appreciate the dazzling beauty and emotional breadth of Mozart's music,\" Hagopian tells the BBC. Nevertheless, he adds, we can't ignore the political resonances. \"The allegorical space that satirical Czech film-makers like Forman opened up meant that audiences began to look for, even perhaps invent, allegorical political meaning,\" he says. \"All films could be read against the grain of a regime that lacked not only humanity but any sense of irony about itself. So if Amadeus wasn't really about Soviet-style tyranny, but audiences merely thought it was, well, I have a feeling that would be just fine with Miloš Forman.\" For his part, Abraham is candid about what he believes are the more contemporary political stakes of the film, as he told the BBC in June. \"Think about how many Americans now idolise Putin. These autocrats are suddenly celebrated again. It's disheartening, truly demoralising, but if Amadeus can help us see our current predicament through fresh eyes, that shows you how powerfully its message still resonates.\" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Now, thanks to the Lost Bass search project, the Beatle has been reunited with the bass, which had been until recently stashed in a Sussex attic. Both McCartney and Höfner, the instrument manufacturer, authenticated the found item upon its rediscovery, and a spokesperson for McCartney told BBC News he was \"incredibly grateful\" for the return of his lost guitar. More like this: Squid Game season 2: Everything we know so far This is Me… Now: A Love Story: Why J-Lo deserves respect for her 'bonkers' new musical movie The strange journey behind the TikTok duo replacing Lin Manuel Miranda for the Moana sequel But McCartney certainly isn't the only musician to lose a valuable piece of his kit – in fact, he's not even the only Beatle. And for non-Beatles-level musical acts, the loss of an instrument – or worse, an entire kit – can be devastating. The BBC previously reported on the theft of rock band Cemetery Sun's entire kit and van, as well as trio Noisy's stolen kit reappearing with individual instruments and pieces of gear up for auction online weeks later. Bassist Grant Emerson of Americana band Delta Rae recalls having around $10,000 (£7,937) of musical instruments stolen: \"We played at the Bitter End in New York City and parked our van down the street. When we came back to the van, the back door had been broken into, and all of our guitars were gone, plus a pedal board and a piece of the drummer's equipment. Probably four to five pieces of gear were stolen. It was a really terrible drive back to North Carolina.\" He notes that for most bands, the only recourse is fundraising: \"You just rely on your fans. You ask for help and donations, which isn't easy.\" And he urges all musicians to \"photograph the serial number of every instrument and piece of gear you own\". Lost or stolen instruments over the years have kept musicians and fans alike searching for guitars, violins, and even an entire brass band. Here are a few more musical mysteries – some of which remain unsolved to this day. The famous blues legend was known for riffs on his legendary guitar, a Gibson he named Lucille – in fact, King had multiple performance guitars named Lucille over the course of his career. The name was inspired by a lover’s quarrel King witnessed in 1949 (the woman arguing was named Lucille, and she left quite an impression on King). When this particular Lucille guitar was stolen, it was eventually found in a Las Vegas pawn shop by Eric Dahl, a fellow musician who mistakenly purchased the guitar and later returned it to King. Dahl offered it without compensation and went on to write a book about King and his many guitars. The Gibson also ended up being one of the last instruments King played before his death in 2015, and it was subsequently sold at his estate auction for $280,000 (£222,286) in 2019. Clapton's Gibson Les Paul guitar, named Beano, was stolen soon after his studio album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton was released in 1966. Unlike King, Clapton hasn't been so lucky as to be reunited with his lost guitar – yet. But singer-songwriter Joe Bonamassa has claimed he knows where it is: In 2016, Bonamassa gave an interview in which he said the guitar was in a private US collection, which spurred a 2018 petition to encourage Bonamassa to reveal more details. On their YouTube channel, music aficionados Baxter and Jonathan of North Carolina-based Casino Guitars joked that they imagine a \"guitar illuminati\" trading in lost and rare instruments might not be pleased with what Bonamassa has already shared so far – and pondered whether he has a responsibility to help Clapton retrieve the stolen item if he does, in fact, know where it is. A violin made in 1675 by Nicolo Amati in Italy was stolen in 2005 from the home of Japanese violinist Takiko Omura, who had purchased the instrument in the United States many decades earlier. The violin, which was priced at nearly £300,000 ($377,895) in 2005 when it was taken, was reportedly found in 2020 in Parma, Italy, in the raid of a home of a suspected drug trafficker. Authorities in Italy and Japan worked together to return the instrument to its rightful owner. It's difficult enough to find one lost guitar, let alone an entire brass band. In 2022, a famous local New Orleans \"second line\" brass band had all their equipment stolen from their van during the worst possible time for them – two weeks before New Orleans Jazz Fest. Nearly $12,000 (£9,526) in musical instruments, including cymbals, drum sets, keyboards and amps, were stolen when the band's van disappeared from outside the home of a band member. The theft threatened to derail the Stooges' festival appearance that year, but the band is back on its feet, with a scheduled appearance on 28 April at this year's Jazz Fest. As the BBC has previously reported, the violin prodigy Min Kym's Stradivarius was stolen in 2010 from a Pret a Manger restaurant. This was no ordinary violinist and no ordinary violin: At just seven years old, Kym had earned a slot at the prestigious Purcell School of Music in the UK, and at age 11, she won first prize at the Premier Mozart International Competition. When presented with the opportunity to own a rare 1696 Stradivarius, \"Kym remortgaged her flat and bought the violin for £450,000 ($580,000). If this seems like an astronomical amount of money, it was in fact a steal in Stradivarius terms: the violin's actual worth was closer to £1.2m ($1.5m) and these instruments are so precious that their value only ever goes up,” reads the 2017 article about the crime. Although the stolen violin was eventually recovered three years later, it was not returned to Kym, and her memoir, Gone: A Girl, A Violin, A Life Unstrung, tells the story of coping with a musical instrument being lost and found and then lost again. Sir Paul wasn't even the only Beatle whose beloved instrument was absconded with: George Harrison's 1965 Rickenbacker guitar was allegedly stolen in 1966. Rickenbacker CEO John Hall told Reverb that the guitar's mystery has been so longstanding because \"no one knows the exact serial number of the original guitar.\" The Rickenbacker team were, however, able to narrow the list down to five potential guitars based on shipment dates. Harrison also had his '57 Les Paul, Lucy – which was formerly owned by the Lovin' Spoonful's John Sebastian, Rick Derringer, and Eric Clapton – stolen. It was nabbed from Harrison's home during a burglary in 1973 and then sold to a Los Angeles music store who, in turn, sold it to Mexican musician Miguel Ochoa, who declined to sell it back to Harrison at full price. Instead, Ochoa negotiated a trade with Harrison: Harrison got Lucy back, and Ochoa would get a 1958 Les Paul Standard and a Fender Precision bass. In his 2009 song Say What's Real, produced by Kanye West, Drake revealed that he lost some of his best lyrics in Mexico: \"Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo/So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll,\" he raps, followed by an expletive-laden line that finishes the rhyme. For his genre of music, that Blackberry was his instrument, which he used to pen his songs. While it doesn't sound like it's ever been returned, Drake has probably upgraded his tech.

        "content": "Two hundred and fifty years ago, several small farming communities rose up against the British and helped form a new nation. Now, the towns are gearing up to party like it's 1775. On 19 April 2025, Lexington, Concord and two other neighbouring towns north-west of Boston will mark the 250th anniversary of the chilly spring day in 1775 when Massachusetts militiamen faced off against British forces in a clash that launched the US on a path to independence. The fateful die was cast when Paul Revere arrived on horseback to the small farming community of Lexington to warn leaders that British soldiers were marching from Boston to seize colonial military supplies stored in Concord, a few miles down the road. When the British arrived, they found a small force of local militiamen, known as Minutemen, waiting in the dawn light. No one knows who fired the first shot, but when the skirmish was over, eight Minutemen lay dead, along with one British soldier. The British forces marched on to Concord where they met a larger force of Minutemen by the North Bridge. After fierce fighting and significant losses on both sides, the British retreated. Marching back to Boston, British troops faced a running battle as the towns of Lincoln, Lexington and Menotomy (now Arlington) had mustered their militias to mount an organised resistance. The American War of Independence had begun. Every year, the events of 19 April are celebrated with various historical reenactments and other special events in these small Massachusetts towns. But with additional celebrations planned in honour of the 250th anniversary, organisers are expecting this year's festivities to draw more travellers than ever before to what many call \"the birthplace of American liberty\". This year's festivities kick off on 18 April with a commemoration of Paul Revere's famous midnight ride to Lexington, followed by a reenactment of the Battle of Lexington the following morning. On 21 April, an event honouring the opening shot of the Battles of Lexington and Concord will take place at Concord's North Bridge, while a host of special exhibits, lectures and parades will take place throughout April. Two and a half centuries after shaping American history, Lexington's colonial heritage remains a defining presence, offering year-round visitors a window into the past. The Lexington Battle Green, where the Minutemen met the British forces, remains the centre of the quiet, 34,000-person community. A statue of farmer-turned Minuteman captain John Parker stands at one end, facing the direction from where British troops approached. Elsewhere, a stone marker on the Lexington Battle Green is engraved with the words Parker is said to have uttered to his men: \"Don't fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.\" A memorial obelisk marks the spot where the Minutemen killed in the battle were reburied after being moved from their original graves in the nearby Old Burying Ground. Nearby, the Lexington Visitors Center provides an overview of the events of 19 April along with a detailed diorama of the battle. From April through October, Liberty Ride trolley tours whisk travellers from the Visitors Center to historical sites in Lexington and Concord along the Battle Road that connects the two towns. Next door to the Visitors Center, Buckman Tavern, where the Minuteman gathered before the clash, is one of three historic houses maintained by the Lexington Historical Society. The other two include Munroe Tavern, which was occupied by retreating British soldiers after the battle; and the Hancock-Clarke House, where patriot leaders John Hancock and Samuel Adams were staying when Revere arrived to sound the alarm. More like this: • The illegal church at the heart of US history • The first Black American global superstar • The only US capital with a royal residence \"Buckman Tavern really gives you a good overview of the battle, but also what life was like in 1775,\" said Lexington High School student Sabrina Bhattacharjya, who runs the history website Lexington250.com. \"My personal favourite is the Hancock-Clarke House. You kind of get to hear the kids' experience of the [American] Revolution. Elizabeth Clarke was a 12-year-old girl who wrote everything down that night in her diary, because she watched the midnight ride and Battle of Lexington out [of] her bedroom window.\" Monroe Tavern, in contrast, presents the perspective of the British, who used it as a field hospital during their retreat. \"It asks my very favourite question, and that is: who [were] the real patriots that day?\" said Craig Sandler, president of the board of the Lexington Historical Society, noting that British soldiers viewed the colonists as rebelling against their rightful king. \"The [British] were noble in their own way. You can't tell the story without both sides because it doesn't make sense.\" Just before the anniversary in April, the Lexington Historical Society will open a new museum in the Lexington Depot, a long-empty former train station built in 1846 in downtown Lexington. The museum will tell the story of the town through Revolutionary-era artefacts and other items that have been off-view for decades. In addition to a larger-than-usual parade, filmmaker Ken Burns is scheduled to visit both Lexington and Concord on 17 April to present his new documentary series The American Revolution. Lexington's anniversary celebrations will also include a visit from approximately 250 members of the US Army's Old Guard and a dramatic landing on Lexington Green by the Golden Knights, the US Army Parachute Team. From Lexington, the British marched on to Concord through the town of Lincoln, along today's Battle Road. Much of the route they took is now part of Minute Man National Historical Park, as is the battle site at the North Bridge near downtown Concord. Visitor centres in Lincoln and near the North Bridge in Concord are good starting points to learn more, with educational films to set the stage. The park also incorporates several historic houses from the Revolutionary period and conducts anniversary reenactments of the Battle of Concord and other dramatic events of 19 April, including the capture of Paul Revere. This year, the park is holding special events throughout April to mark the 250th anniversary, the highlight of which will be a Battle Road Tactical Demonstration on 19 April, where costumed interpreters will recreate battle tactics and the fighting that took place as the British retreated towards Boston. \"It will be the largest living history event of all the 250th events in this area. We have over 750-800 living historians that will be joining us for a whole day of events,\" said Minute Man park ranger Jim Hollister. \"On the night of the 12th, we're doing an evening programme at Hartwell Tavern portraying the ride of Samuel Prescott, who escaped capture after Paul Revere was captured by a British patrol, and he brings the alarm to the town of Lincoln.\" Concord's Visitor Center also offers guided tours focusing on the Revolution, including one called A Fight for Freedom: Patriots of Color. Stops include the historic Wright Tavern where Concord Minutemen gathered early on 19 April and British troops later established their headquarters. The town is also developing an app-based augmented reality tour that will be available this spring. \"The idea is that you get superimposed on an object,\" said Concord Tourism Manager Beth Williams. \"Walk into the Wright Tavern and a 3D figure could come up like a hologram and say, 'Oh, when I was 12, I worked as a barmaid in the Wright Tavern.' It gives another layer to the history, certainly to a younger demographic that is more used to getting content in that way.\" Nearby, the Concord Museum has an extensive collection of artefacts related to the Revolution. \"We're able to narrate the events of the day essentially minute by minute, with objects that were actually there and that participated. The interpretive material is drawn from the words of participants to the degree that we're able,\" explained curator David Woods. Beyond visiting the museum and the historic site at the North Bridge, Woods recommends an exercise in observation and imagination. \"Standing in the centre of town,\" he said, \"look around for 18th-Century structures. Any one that you can see, it's reasonable to suspect that there were supplies stored there. You can go up on to the Old Hill Burying Ground, stand right where [British officers] Colonel Smith and Major Pitcairn stood looking at the North Bridge sizing the thing up. There was a mountain of supplies in Concord and they didn't find it.\" Asked why the events of Lexington and Concord continue to resonate with visitors, Hollister said, \"It's a very accessible story. The main actors weren't great generals and warriors – they were ordinary people just like us: men and women who were confronted with a crisis and had to decide what's worth fighting for. That's something I think every generation has to confront as they move through history in their own time.\" \"It's this feeling that this was the start. This was the first shot,\" added Bhattacharjya. \"We are a nation of immigrants. That first shot on the battlefield is what brought so many people here, and that's how we've grown as a country. All the inventions and all the greatness of America, it all started because you had a first shot.\" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "Bangkok-born actor Dom Hetrakul plays a hotel spa therapist in The White Lotus season three. Here are his top tips for visiting Phuket, Koh Samui and Bangkok. Since its tourism boom in the mid-20th Century, Thailand has become synonymous with paradisical landscapes and top-notch hospitality. In recent years, however, the Southeast Asian country has risen beyond its reputation as a spiritual and adventure haven, partially due to acclaimed film productions and influential names drawing attention to its unique culture. Today, the country's cultural influence has reached nearly every industry, from fashion to sports to entertainment. For a prime example, look no further than the highly anticipated third instalment of HBO's series The White Lotus, which premiered 16 February 2025. Following successful stopovers in Hawaii and Italy, season three features Thailand as its latest lush backdrop for intrigue and social satire. The islands of Koh Samui and Phuket are the main filming locations (with a smattering of scenes shot in Bangkok), while an ensemble of Thai actors including Blackpink's Lisa Manobal, Patravadi Mejudhon, Tayme Thapthimthong and actor, model and businessman Dom Hetrakul join the star-studded cast. Bangkok-born Dom Hetrakul has built a portfolio as an actor, model and TV presenter while juggling his job as a motorcycle trading businessman. He has starred in several local and international productions, including Bangkok Dangerous (2008), Twilight Over Burma (2015) and The Family (2023). Hetrakul's most recent screen venture is HBO's The White Lotus season three, where he plays a Thai hotel spa attendant. \"The series is a very deep and dark comedy so it's going to be fun when it comes to Thailand, which has a different background compared to Hawaii and Sicily,\" says Hetrakul, who plays Pornchai, the beatific hotel spa therapist at the Thai branch of the fictional White Lotus resort. \"We have strong values and beliefs influenced by our religious background, but we're still dynamic in a way. That might be something very distinctive when you get close to the Thai community [and why] everyone is looking at Thailand as one of the most famous destinations for tourism.\" Hetrakul, who was born in Bangkok and calls the city home, balances his career in entertainment with a job in the motorcycle trading business. But his packed schedule has never stopped him from travelling and finding inspiration in his home country: \"Apart from acting, sports and motorcycles take me everywhere. To find inspiration you need to get out of your comfort zone, that [means] more places and people to meet.\" Here are Hetrakul's favourite places in Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Samui. Home to the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui where much of the season's hotel scenes were filmed, Koh Samui is perhaps the ultimate White Lotus set-jetting destination. Indeed, a good deal of the season's drama and privileged behaviour unfolds on the palm-laden island, located in the Gulf of Thailand. Most visitors arrive in Koh Samui via the Samui International Airport, but ferries and other means of transportation are available from Surat Thani Province. \"You can take a cruise about 45 minutes from the mainland,\" Hetrakul says. While its rugged coastline, majestic mountain ranges and long, sandy beaches make it a travel-worthy getaway, the island's wellness offerings have stimulated tourism in recent years; something keenly noted in season three, with the surprise return of fan-favourite spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) from The White Lotus season one, whose story arc involves learning Thai wellness techniques from Hetrakul's Pornchai so she can improve her practice in Maui. Koh Samui's luxurious spas, remote resorts and holistic health centres provide wellness and spiritual therapies and retreats for meditation, Ayurvedic treatments and massages, but Hetrakul suggests immersing yourself in yoga. \"In Koh Samui, they have a lot of different training experiences like Thai boxing and yoga,\" he says. \"But [I'd recommend] yoga by the beach every morning with yogis from around the world... That's a very healthy community.\" Address: Ko Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand Thai people's love for food runs deep so no trip to Thailand is complete without indulging in the country's culinary delicacies. \"Over here, we eat all day, all night – daytime, office hours – we just order food and eat all the time,\" Hetrakul says. \"Restaurants have to open all day.\" Tip: If you wish to experience one of Thailand's more emblematic celebrations, consider visiting during Songkran (Thai New Year). The festivities run between 13-15 April 2025 and celebrate the end of summer, welcoming the rainy season with water-pouring traditions. \"The Songkran Festival is chaotic in the best sense, to be honest,\" says Hetrakul. \"It's not really the traditional, soft [kind of experience]; it's [high power] stuff.\" While you'll have to watch the upcoming episodes to see the exact dishes and restaurants featured in The White Lotus season three, Koh Samui is packed with delicious food options from Western-style restaurants (Hetrakul likes Summer by Coco Tam, The Shack and Gusto Italiano) to local eateries like Hetrakul's favourite island haunt, Jun Hom. The unassuming beachside spot is recognised for its seafood and homemade traditional dishes like pineapple fried rice, silver sillago fish and yum tua pu(wing bean salad). \"Everything is from the local fisherman's market,\" Hetrakul says, citing the Fisherman's Village Night Market, another go-to spot for foodies in Koh Samui – and rumoured to be the setting for some of season three's Songkran Festival shenanigans. \"Those aromatic herbs, spicy chillies and coconut milk on all sorts of fish, crabs, and prawns – you name it – Jun Hom makes [it].\" Website: https://www.facebook.com/JunhomKohSamui Address: 7/3 Mu 5, Mae Nam, Ko Samui, 84330 Phone: +66 77 602 008 Whether at exclusive high-voltage clubs or vibrant festivals by the ocean, Thailand's much-revered party scene lives up to the hype. Previews of season three offer glimpses at the White Lotus' take on Thai nightlife; neon lights, fireworks and dance performances spice up the intricate plot entanglements in the trailer. Tip: Nightlife is at the core of the Thai travelling experience. \"You'll see the nightlife in the White Lotus season three,\" says Hetrakul. \"For some [previous portrayals onscreen] you might have seen The Hangover II or The Beach – that's how crazy we go. It depends on how you [pick] the places. You have premium clubs at hotels, but also very affordable places.\" If you're in Bangkok, he recommends checking out the options [on] Sukhumvit Road, one of the world's longest roads, which runs from Thailand to Cambodia. Hetrakul's top Thai party hotspot is Ko Pha Ngan island, about 38km from Koh Samui – eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted Phangan Mantra Inn located near Ko Pha Ngan's Haad Rin Beach in the trailer's party scenes. \"[Koh Pha Ngan] is famous for the Full Moon Party,\" says Hetrakul, referring to the monthly festival-style beach parties that take over Haad Rin Beach every full Moon night or the day after. Locals and visitors celebrate by gathering around stages lined up across the shore for performances of various musical genres. For those wary of big crowds – the parties attract thousands of attendants – Hetrakul has an insider tip. \"Now, people are trying to host more parties, they call them the Half Moon Parties,\" he says. \"Full Moon is more exposed to the public, so you expect the crowds, but Half Moon [celebrations] are less packed.\" Address: Koh Phangan District, Surat Thani, Thailand About 30km north-west of Koh Samui lies the Mu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park, an enclave of 42 islands surrounded by turquoise sea. The archipelago's clear-water shores welcome The White Lotus guests, serving as a fitting introduction to Thailand's stunning seascapes. Though camping areas and bungalows are available on Ko Wua Talap, the park's largest island,  Hetrakul recommends planning a day trip to the archipelago to explore luscious tropical forests, azure beaches and rugged landscapes apt for any type of visitor, from those seeking a calm, stress-free retreat to adventure enthusiasts. \"There are white-sand beaches and mountain ranges on the island itself, so you can enjoy a beach tour or hiking, depending on which of those small islands you prefer,\" says Hetrakul. \"[Ang Thong National Park is also] great for snorkelling, diving, kayaking, canoeing or camping.\" For wildlife lovers, if you're lucky enough, you may even come across cadres of cute-looking spectacled leaf monkeys. Address: Koh Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand Connected to the mainland via the 600m-long Sarasin Bridge, Phuket is Thailand's largest island. It's also home to various locations featured in The White Lotus season three, from the opulent Michelin Guide-recommended Ta Khai restaurant, where characters are seen dining (and whining), to the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket resort, whose lavish spa serves as a backdrop for the interactions between Hetrakul's Pornchai and Rothwell's Belinda. \"Phuket's [highlights] are the nightlife and the beach – Patong beach, the bars and clubs,\" Hetrakul says. However, those who venture beyond will be rewarded with splendid natural views and zealously protected greenery. \"About an hour's drive from Old Phuket Town, in the north of the island, there is a well-preserved mangrove forest called Baan Tha Chatchai,\" the actor says. Here, community-based ecotourism is king; away from crowds, visitors can engage in activities such as kayaking and canoeing along shallow and still waterways. \"Deep in the jungle it's very calm, so you don't have to worry too much. [For example,] in the western part of Thailand, the waves are stronger, [but this is] a different current.\" Local dishes such as mee hokkien (chewy egg noodles) or Phuket lobster top off an excursion to the area. \"They have a lot of restaurants around, some deep in the forest. It's very very traditional – truly local – food,\" Hetrakul emphasises. \"They have seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit. But to be warned, the food is mostly spicy.\" Address: Within Phuket Marine National Park Operation Centre 2, 92/7 Moo 5 Mai Khao, Thalang, Phuket 83110 Thailand's cultural appeal doesn't stop at its beloved spicy food and notoriously wild festivals. For decades, sports, especially Muay Thai, have driven the country's soft power strategy; in early February, the Thai government launched a year-long campaign titled Grand Tourism and Sports Year 2025, aimed at leveraging the sports calendar to boost tourism. The national passion for Muay Thai is reflected in The White Lotus season three, as various characters chat about the fights and take in a match at Phuket's Bangla Boxing Stadium Paton. As a sports enthusiast – he practices Muay Thai – Hetrakul encourages visitors to soak up Thailand's sports tradition and learn about its origins. \"We do lots of [sports but] Muay Thai, previously called Thai boxing, has become mainstream,\" he says. \"If you're a fan of UFC (mixed martial arts) fights, most elite athletes are here for training. If they're talking about the striking, Muay Thai [has] one of the best striking techniques.\" While you can witness Thailand's most famous combat sport or book a class nearly anywhere in Thailand – \"there are a lot of Muay Thai camps around [the country],\" Hetrakul says – the actor recommends stopping by the Rajadamnern Stadium in his hometown of Bangkok. Located just a few blocks from the Wat Benchamabophit temple, Rajadamnern was Thailand's first venue uniquely dedicated to Muay Thai and was responsible for introducing the sports' official ranking system and rule book. The stadium is also recognised for its architecture and circular ring – the only one of its kind in the world. The venue hosts combat every night, but Hetrakul advises visitors to get tickets for Friday and Saturday when the most anticipated clashes are generally scheduled. Website: https://rajadamnern.com/ Address: 8 Ratchadamnoen Nok Rd, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok 10100 Instagram: @rajadamnern_stadium Prominently featured in season three's storyline, Thai wellness and healing practices need no introduction. Nuad Thai, or Thai massage, for example, was inscribed in 2019 on Unesco's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This manual therapy, aimed at realigning a person's body and energy, is one of Thailand's most popular and widespread cultural attractions; Hetrakul's Pornchai even performs Nuad Thai on Rothwell's Belinda when showing her his \"signature treatment.\" The Buddhist temple Wat Pho, credited as the birthplace of Nuad Thai, is Hetrakul's recommendation to experience and learn about Thai massage. The complex, which houses Bangkok's largest reclining Buddha, was the city's first public education centre. Inside, the walls document centuries of knowledge on Thai healing techniques with a series of engraved marble slabs dated to the 19th Century. As home to the Watpho Thai Traditional Medicine School, today the temple lures visitors interested in undergoing massage therapy. \"It's a place [to receive] traditional Thai massage,\" says Hetrakul. \"[But] they can [also] certify you with the approval of the Ministry of Health. You just need time to apply if you're interested in traditional Thai massage.\" Website: https://www.watpomassage.com/EN/about Address: 392 / 33-34 Soi Pen Phat 1, Grand Palace, Maharat Road Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok 10200 BBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "From bubblegum-coloured lakes in Australia to a solar-powered safari camp in Botswana, these are BBC journalists' top destinations this year. Travel has the power to connect, inspire and even transform us. Peering over the edge of a crashing waterfall in Newfoundland and ascending sawtooth spires in the Italian Dolomites reveal how wondrous the world can be. But while travel should be a force for good, the past year has reminded us that it also has the potential to overwhelm and even harm the places we love, and many destinations are now imposing new restrictions as they grapple with the negative effects of overtourism. In the BBC's inaugural guide to the best places to travel this year, we wanted to highlight the destinations experiencing the opposite phenomenon. Each of these 25 spots is not only welcoming visitors and offering incredible travel experiences, but also using tourism to support local communities, protect the environment or preserve their unique cultural heritage. We compiled the list with input from BBC Travel journalists and some of the world's leading sustainable travel authorities, such as the United Nations World Travel Organization, Sustainable Travel International, the Black Travel Alliance and the World Travel & Tourism Council. As tourism in many regions soars past pre-pandemic levels, and extreme weather and climate change reveal the fragile impermanence of many bucket-list destinations, travelling thoughtfully means considering where your trip can serve a larger good. From trekking through a moonlike landscape in Bolivia to Arctic glamping in Greenland on the world's largest island, your next great adventure is just ahead. Ever wanted to swim alongside sperm whales? Dominica now offers the chance to do it in an ethical, sustainable way as part of the Caribbean island's groundbreaking commitment to marine conservation and regenerative tourism. The island nation recently established the world's first sperm whale reserve, a protected marine area designed to safeguard its resident giants. Limited permits for whale swims ensure intimate, respectful encounters, offering visitors a once-in-a-lifetime experience to share the water with these incredible cetaceans while facilitating research and creating sustainable tourism opportunities for local residents. New for 2025, expanded infrastructure and systems are set to welcome visitors, including digital immigration forms to ease arrival and the development of a cable-car system taking riders from Roseau Valley up to Boiling Lake, one of the world's largest thermal springs. Access to the island has never been easier: on top of existing American Airlines flights from Miami, United Airlines is launching direct flights from Newark starting 15 February. Several new hotels are opening in 2025 (adding nearly 500 rooms with a 25% increase in inventory), including the six-star Hilton Tranquility Beach Resort and Spa in Salisbury. Or choose a tried-and-true classic such as Secret Bay, a luxury eco-property that frequently tops sustainability lists. Dominica is also home to Project CETI, a groundbreaking international effort to decode whale language, clicks and codas, led by National Geographic Explorer David Gruber. Elsewhere, visitors can explore hidden gorges, towering waterfalls and feast on local cuisine at unique eateries, such as the farm-to-table Lacou. Dominica isn't just a destination – it's a movement to support a burgeoning model of eco-tourism that balances biodiversity conservation with economic growth, ensuring that your adventure helps protect this natural paradise for generations to come. – Pier Nirandara Home to one of Yayoi Kusama's iconic yellow, polka-dotted Pumpkin sculptures, the Japanese island of Naoshima has become a must-see destination for connoisseurs of contemporary art and architecture. Once known (if at all) for its highly polluting copper smelting industry, the island's transformation is thanks to Benesse Art Site Naoshima, which has helped create major museums and site-specific artworks in the scenically stunning (and dramatically population-dwindling) Seto Inland Sea, located between Japan's main island of Honshu and Shikoku. Spring 2025 sees the opening of the Naoshima New Museum of Art, designed by Tadao Ando, the award-winning architect behind nine other projects on the island. This new showcase for works by Asian artists will be a major highlight of this year's Setouchi Triennale, with events and unveilings of artwork scattered across 17 islands and coastal areas of the Seto Inland Sea. Scheduled over 100 days and split between spring, summer and autumn to allow visitors to enjoy the region through the different seasons, this is the largest iteration of the Triennale since it began in 2010. The festival and activities of Benesse Art Site Naoshima have been instrumental in turning not only Naoshima's fortunes around but also reviving the neighbouring islands of Teshima and Inujima. Book ahead to visit Rei Naito and Ryue Nishizawa's Teshima Art Museum, a one-of-a-kind synthesis of art, architecture and nature; while on Inujima, travellers will be amazed by the remains of a historic copper refinery reimagined as an epic-scale art installation. Memorable places to stay include Roka, a contemporary-styled ryokan on Naoshima, and the elegantly minimalist Espoir Inn on Teshima. – Simon Richmond Perpetual fan favourite Italy hardly needs more press – especially in a year when its supremely overtouristed capital, Rome, will be even more overwhelmed due to the 2025 Jubilee. But if Italy is still on your bucket list for 2025, consider taking a detour north to the Dolomite Mountains. For Italians, the ruggedly beautiful Dolomites are synonymous with family fun and luxury holidays. The stunning sawtooth limestone cliffs sprawl across the regions of Veneto, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, attracting vacationing Italians in droves each year for their exquisite villages; peerless \"white week\" skiing; epic hike; and world-class, stick-to-your-ribs Alpine dishes. This classic Italian playground is often overlooked by overseas visitors – but that's all poised to change. The \"Queen of the Dolomites\", Cortina d'Ampezzo, has been slated to co-host the 2026 Winter Olympics. The preparations, which will take place throughout 2025, include a vast series of infrastructure improvements throughout the area – all against a backdrop of pre-Olympic buzz. Visitors can expect to find expanded ski lift networks in the Dolomiti Superski area, where the towns of Alta Badia and Val Gardena will launch modernised lifts and enhanced connections to public transit operating within the area. New and upgraded cable cars, lifts and gondolas will also be introduced throughout the regions' towns. But the Dolomites is a thrilling destination in all seasons; visit in spring, summer and autumn to enjoy excellent trails, like 2024's new Cammino Retico (The Rhaetian Way); a 170km, seven-day trail connecting remote villages between the Veneto and Trentino regions. And for pure relaxation, the luxury Aman Rosa Alpina hotel will have its grand reopening in 2025. The property will now offer 51 guest rooms and suites, two presidential suites and the private Chalet Zeno. Visit now, before the crowds descend. – Eva Sandoval There is nowhere on Earth like Greenland. Spanning more than two million sq km, the world's largest island has a population of less than 57,000. Covered by a vast ice cap and spectacular mountains, its unspoiled wilderness and majestic fjords aren't just a coveted geopolitical entity; they offer adventures of a lifetime. Stunning hiking and spellbinding whale watching in summer and traditional dog sledding and the magical aurora in winter all make Greenland a bucket-list destination. However, it has been remote, expensive and time-consuming to reach – until now. With the opening of a new international airport in the capital city of Nuuk and two more following in 2026, getting to Greenland has never been easier. The country is welcoming mindful adventure travellers who love exploring while also respecting its incredible nature and unique Inuit culture. Greenland has adopted a pledge \"towards better tourism\" and a new law aims to steer funds from tourism towards benefitting local communities. A modern town with a historic waterfront, informative museums and impressive art galleries, Nuuk is also a launchpad for hiking, fishing and glamping trips and acts as a gateway for exploring a remarkable Arctic territory. Further north in Ilulissat, visitors can discover the jaw-dropping icebergs of Disko Bay and dramatic Unesco-recognised Icefjord. In the south, a region once settled by Vikings, there are gorgeous fjords and scenic green hills dotted with sheep farms. – Adrienne Murray Nielsen Though just one-sixth the size of England and far less visited than its more famous UK counterparts, Wales is filled with stunning national parks, awe-inspiring medieval castles and virtually no crowds – which only adds to its appeal. The new year offers travellers an additional excuse to explore one of Europe's most up-and-coming destinations: Wales is celebrating 2025 as the Year of Croeso (\"Welcome\"). The year-long event showcases Welsh culture, language and attractions while inviting visitors to \"Feel the hwyl\" – an untranslatable Welsh word describing a deep state of joy that comes from being immersed in the moment. In recent years, Wales has positioned itself at the forefront of sustainable, culturally focused travel. Tourism has helped play a role in the revival of the Welsh language and the nation is in the midst of a multi-year £5 billion programme that uses tourism funds to make various destinations more environmentally sustainable. As part of its Year of Croeso, Wales is investing in mobility bikes to help more adventure-seekers explore its wild side. What's more, Wales is home to the Wales Coast Path, the only hiking path in the world that runs the entire length of a country's coastline. – Eliot Stein Labrador, the mainland portion of Newfoundland and Labrador in eastern Canada, is a vast, rugged region known for its windswept coastal villages, towering icebergs, subarctic forests and massive waterfalls – all underpinned by more than 9,000 years of human history. In 2025, the completion of the last stage of the 1,200km Trans-Labrador Highway – a feat that took nearly 25 years and $1bn to build – transforms this remote 294,330 sq km landscape into a more accessible destination. The new circular route (known as Expedition 51) connects Labrador with five Canadian provinces while offering detours into the US and even France (via St Pierre and Miquelon). To encourage sustainable tourism and celebrate the cultural heritage in this formerly isolated part of the north, the Canadian government has invested $180m into Parks Canada sites in Western Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2025, Red Bay National Historic Site, a Unesco World Heritage Site and former Basque whaling station, will debut a new interactive boardwalk and visitor centre; L'Anse aux Meadows, home to the first Norse settlement in North America, is enhancing its ecological protections and upgrading visitor facilities; while Gros Morne National Park will introduce new interpretive exhibits that highlight the park's dramatic geology, wildlife and landscapes. – Diane Selkirk Tucson has a lot to celebrate in 2025. This year marks the 10th anniversary of when it became the first city in the US to receive a Unesco City of Gastronomy distinction, as well as the 250th anniversary of the city's founding. Originally part of Mexico, the area now called Tucson will celebrate its unique multi-national history, as well as the deep-rooted Native American cultures that make it special, with a free event on 23 August featuring traditional Mexican music and dancing held at the Presidio San Agustin del Tucson. Visitors throughout the year can explore Tucson's miles of desert hiking trails and historic buildings – like the 250-year-old San Xavier del Bac, the so-called \"White Dove of the Desert\". Preservation like this points to why the city is set to receive a Sustainability Index Award from the Global Destination Sustainability Movement (GDS) this year. But while the building's history is impressive, the nearby gardens reveal an even richer history: they are the oldest continuously cultivated soil in the US. Four thousand years ago, the Tohono O'odham's ancestors farmed squashes, beans and corn on this land. After mixing and melding with Mexican and other Indigenous flavours over the centuries, many of these ancient herbs and crops are still staples in kitchens across the city. Diners can immerse themselves in the city's unique food scene at one of its city-of-gastronomy-certified restaurants or Heirloom Farmers Markets, which regularly feature unique local ingredients such as chiltepin chilis, edible cacti called nopales and prickly pear. – Lynn Brown Known as the world's most isolated big city, Perth – and the state of Western Australia (WA) – have long played second fiddle to the east coast cities of Melbourne and Sydney. However, with Australia's only direct flights to Europe, Perth is positioning itself as Australia's western gateway and a global aviation hub, with a $5bn redevelopment of Perth Airport set to enhance the travel experience. And with new connections to Asia, WA is poised to become a must-visit destination in 2025. But it's not just about getting here – it's about what awaits. Outside of newly cool Perth and its gorgeous Swan Valley Wine Region, WA's vast landscapes span more than 2.5 million sq km, encompassing 12,500km of pristine coastline, bubblegum-pink lakes, horizontal waterfalls, towering karri forests, wildflowers, wineries and wildlife encounters like swimming with whale sharks and snapping selfies with quokkas, the \"happiest animal in the world\". Sustainability-minded road trippers can explore it all on the new 6,600km Electric Vehicle Highway, the world's longest EV charging network. WA is also championing its rich cultural heritage through the A$20m Jina Aboriginal Tourism Action Plan that supports authentic Indigenous-led experiences for travellers as well as Indigenous business development. Learn about the oldest living cultures on Earth on a truth-telling walking tour in Rockingham or a 4WD tag-along coast foraging tour complete with bush barbecue in Broome. Add ancient petroglyphs at Murujuga National Park (under consideration for Unesco World Heritage status in 2025), new disability-friendly infrastructure and equipment on the stunning Houtman Abrolhos Islands, boutique hotels in Fremantle and tiny dream stays in the Great Southern, and WA is set to redefine travel to Australia this year. – Ellie Cobb From its misty hilltop tea plantations and roaming wild elephants to its ancient temples and rolling surf, Sri Lanka is a country that ticks lots of boxes. In April 2022, the former prime minister announced Sri Lanka's bankruptcy, but a new president aims to rebuild the country's fortunes after it was hit by a pandemic and civil unrest. The resilient island nation is hoping to get back on its feet through tourism. The city of Kandy will see the opening of its first seven-star hotel, Aviyana Private Chalets, while Aarunya Nature Resort has a new family villa that includes an oculus for stargazing. There's a $1bn megaresort opening in Colombo, and the launch of Sri Lanka's new airline Air Ceilão, which will fly as far as Europe and Australia. The nation also recently launched the Good Travel Seal initiative, which celebrates local businesses who have adopted sustainable practices. Visitors looking for a coolcation can take a legendary train ride into its mountainous interior, or travel to Colombo and Galle to discover a new generation of mixologists putting their spin on arrack, a 5th-Century drink. The island has also opened the 300km Pekoe Trail, which takes hikers through tea plantations and rural villages in the Central Highlands. For those who want to cover more ground, an innovative startup allows travellers to self-drive a tuk tuk across the island, with the money going directly to the owner. – Claire Turrell After managing the Panama Canal for decades, the US handed control of it over to Panama at the end of 1999 in a treaty signed by the late US President Jimmy Carter. This year marks the 25th anniversary of Panama's sovereignty over its namesake waterway, and as President-elect Donald Trump hints at the possibility of using military force to reseize it, a series of new permanent exhibits at the landmark's Museo del Canal highlighting its path to Panamanian rule feels especially timely. Yet, there's more to see in this nation of vast jungles, idyllic islands and mountainous forests beyond the canal. In 2024, the Meaningful Travel Map to Panama launched in partnership with non-profit Tourism Cares to make it easier for visitors to find locally led travel experiences across the country. After embarking on a Localinpty walking tour through Panama City's Casco Antiguo and El Chorrillo neighbourhoods, head south-west to the La Pintada district, where artists weave fibers to make traditional Panama hats by hand – a Unesco-recognised practice known as sombrero pintao. In El Valle de Anton (named one of the best community tourism villages by UN Tourism in 2024) take a hike through a lush cloud forest on the Cerro Gaital Lookout Trail where you can see both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea on a clear day from the summit. This newly opened path is part of Panama's ongoing 1,000 km of Trails project, which seeks to boost sustainable tourism in rural communities while bringing hikers face to face with Panama's staggering biodiversity. – Kathleen Rellihan Snowcapped mountains, sweeping deserts, ancient cities and rich cultural heritage have long made Morocco one of North Africa's most popular destinations. But the Al Haouz earthquake of September 2023 not only devastated parts of Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains, it also severely impacted tourism. As Morocco continues to build (and rebuild) its tourism infrastructure in preparation for co-hosting the 2030 FIFA World Cup, the nation is aiming to double its tourist arrivals in the next five years. Bypass the crowds by taking a road trip through the Rif Mountains in Morocco's less-frequented northern region. The planned 2025-2027 expansion of Morocco's High-Speed Rail (HSR) network will create a multitude of new train lines, including a link from Rabat to the ancient, 1,300-year-old walled Rif Mountain city of Fez; home to a Unesco World Heritage medina and the host of several games in the Africa Cup of Nations 2025. From Fez, it's a 65km drive north to Moulay Idriss, an ancient hilltop village once closed to non-Muslims. Pass through olive and almond groves and mountain villages for a stop in Ouezzane – a centre of Sufism – then continue north to Talassemtane National Park to hike through cedar forests, climb craggy red peaks and dive into natural swimming holes. Further north is the town of Chefchaouen, known as the \"Blue Pearl\" for its blue-painted buildings and streets. Finally, cruise along Morocco's northern coast, unwinding in sleepy Mediterranean fishing villages like El Jebha and the white-washed Spanish colonial buildings of Tetouan. – Alicia Erickson The northern English city of Bradford is finally poised to step out from the long shadow cast by its giant Yorkshire neighbour, Leeds, as it takes its place as the 2025 UK City of Culture. A fabulous year-long programme of events includes the re-opening of the National Science and Media Museum, plus innovative celebrations of local cultural icons: more than 400 works by Bradford-born artist David Hockney held in a Unesco World Heritage 1850s mill; new digital takes on a fantasy world dreamed up by the famed literary Brontë sisters; and a musical programme mixing an electronic bassline symphony, old factory folk music, brass bands and South Asian sounds. The diversity of offerings reflects the eye-opening variety of a city whose historic enclaves like Little Germany – where 19th-Century Teutonic wool merchants built an array of neoclassical warehouses – are complemented by a landscape of dramatic moors that play host to an extraordinary open-air immersive sound walk mixing contemporary classical music with a sculpture trail. A special energy also comes from the local residents who represent diverse backgrounds (and youth – a quarter are under 20 years old). Bradford's historic streets and rugged country setting helped the city become Britain's first Unesco City of Film (an accolade shared with places as varied as Rome, Sydney and Busan) – a setting for screen hits including BBC series like Peaky Blinders and Gentleman Jack, and classic films like The Railway Children and Wuthering Heights. And this year, there's even an interactive cookbook project, celebrating recipes from local communities and showing that in 2025, Bradford is truly a destination to please all tastes. – Norman Miller Home to some of the world's most breathtaking desert landscapes and the ancient capital of one of history's most mysterious civilisations, Jordan never fails to evoke wonder. But take a closer look and you'll find that the country has been quietly building up its reputation as the Middle East's go-to destination for outdoor adventure-seekers. Visiting Jordan While the ongoing Israel-Gaza war continues to compromise Jordan's tourism industry, both the UK Foreign Office and US State Department currently consider Jordan to be relatively safe to explore. In 2023, a stunning new 10-day, 120km-long hiking path known as the Wadi Rum Trail opened, which weaves through the rust-red walls of Jordan's iconic Wadi Rum, tracing the otherworldly landscapes featured in the films Star Wars, Dune and The Martian. Visitors have traditionally breezed through the desert here on 4x4 tours, but this community tourism project promotes a slower, more sustainable form of travel that protects the desert's delicate ecosystem while safeguarding the rich cultural heritage of the local Bedouin community. Elsewhere, this Maine-sized nation is teeming with 33 protected land and marine ecosystems. At the Wadi Mujib Biosphere Reserve (the world's lowest-lying nature reserve at 410m below sea level), visitors can search for the illusive desert-dwelling Nubian ibex while climbing, swimming and sliding their way through a sandstone gorge to the base of a crashing waterfall. The Dana Biosphere Reserve (Jordan's largest), is home to 180 bird species and 25 endangered mammal species. The rich coral reefs of the Aqaba Marine Reserve, which was added to the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas in January 2025, support more than 500 fish species and a growing diving scene. – Florence Craig Almost completely isolated from the outside world for centuries, this erstwhile hermit kingdom nestled in the Himalayas only began welcoming foreigners in 1974. It's since become a global leader in sustainability: it's the world's first carbon-negative nation, more than 60% of its land is protected forest and it measures Gross National Happiness instead of GDP. The Haa Valley, a pristine forested district along Bhutan's western frontier with Tibet, has long been the country's best-kept secret: a culturally distinct region still untouched by mass tourism. This forgotten corner of the Thunder Dragon Kingdom was the last district to open to foreigners in 2002, and today, fewer than 2% of international travellers visit, despite it being a yak's graze from Paro International Airport. It's now emerging from the shadows, balancing preservation with thoughtful development in its bid for more visitors. Travellers can explore Haa's raw beauty through the newly restored 400km Trans Bhutan Trail; the freshly-added 11km Haa Panorama Trail (a revival of an ancient route); and the two-day Joy Bay Tsho Trek, which snakes through pastures, canopy forests and bamboo groves between the villages of Mochu and Youkha. Haa's commitment to sustainable tourism means you'll find locally run homestays (and some local hotels) offering glimpses into centuries-old rural life. Two distinct, low-impact accommodations have also opened: the community-run Katsho Eco Camp, built along the Haa Panorama Trail by guides and cooks who lost their jobs during the pandemic, and the luxury Sangwa Camp. Here, visitors witness local culture, like Bon rituals and rare experiences such as breakfast in Bhutan's lone strict nature reserve, a highly protected biodiversity hotspot home to rare species like the red panda and snow leopard. With Bhutan's Sustainable Daily Fee halved through 2027 (now $100), this once-secluded paradise is now more accessible while remaining just as committed to low-impact tourism. – Erin Levi More than a year after a series of deadly wildfires devastated Maui, the entire state is experiencing a dramatic downturn in visitors. As families and local businesses continue to rebuild, they're asking travellers to return, but to do so responsibly. Enter the Mālama Hawaii programme. Meaning \"to protect\" or \"give back\", mālama is a Hawaiian word embodying a sense of stewardship and respect for the environment. As such, the programme pairs travellers with more than 350 volunteer opportunities, ranging from restoring native forests to sewing and cooking with Maui families to helping to preserve plant and animal habitats on the slopes of Mount Kea. In exchange, travellers receive discounted – or in some cases, free – stays at dozens of hotels and resorts across the islands, including the famous Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea where the first season of The White Lotus was filmed. – Eliot Stein Uzbekistan has one of the youngest populations in the world – more than 60% are under 30. Being surrounded by a sea of young people on Tashkent's metros, which double as art museums with Soviet-era mosaics, you can see a new generation taking over. As the country strives to maintain its unique traditions and cultures, it is investing in tourism with new hotels, train routes, domestic flights and cultural attractions to grow its economy, retain its youth and attract more visitors. Uzbekistan is getting its first major international biennial with the Bukhara Biennial in September 2025. Other major cultural developments include an expansion of the State Museum of Arts designed by Tadao Ando and the restoration and partial reconstruction of the Palace of Prince Romanov. As of May 2024, citizens of more than 90 countries (including the UK, Canada and Australia) can visit Uzbekistan without a visa. The president has said he intends to create a Global Green Tourism Startup Lab to bring together the country's commitment to a green economy with tourism. Crossing the border with neighbouring countries has also become easier. The region's first international railway route, the Silk Road railway tour, launched in November 2024 and now connects Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. – Kathleen Rellihan Haida Gwaii, an archipelago of more than 150 islands off the coast of British Columbia, offers more than breathtaking landscapes – it provides a profound connection to nature, culture and history. Isolated from the mainland, the ecologically rich islands are home to more than 6,800 species, including endemic birds, mammals and plants that have sustained the Haida People for at least 15,000 years. What makes Haida Gwaii a standout destination in 2025 is the groundbreaking Gaayhllxid/Gíihlagalgang \"Rising Tide\" Haida Title Lands Agreement. This legislation marks a transformative moment in Indigenous rights in Canada, officially recognising the Council of the Haida Nation as the territory's governing body under federal law. This shift is working to revitalise Haida culture and strengthen their environmental stewardship. Visitors can explore long-abandoned Haida villages like SG̱ang Gwaay, a Unesco World Heritage Site with ancient mortuary poles and longhouse remains; and encounter distinctive wildlife such as the Haida Gwaii black bear (called taan in the local dialect) and seabirds like puffins and ancient murrelets. Upon arrival, guests are introduced to Haida Laws, including the concept of Gina 'waadluxan gud ad kwaagid (\"everything depends on everything else\"), a teaching that underscores our shared responsibility to care for the Earth. – Diane Selkirk Home to mist-shrouded rainforests, emerald lakes, towering volcanoes and one of the Americas' oldest and most attractive cities (Unesco-enshrined Granada, which celebrated its 500th anniversary in December 2024), Central America's largest country remains one of its least visited. That may soon change with the opening of the new Carretera Costanera: a $400m, 350km-long highway linking 53 beaches along the nation's Pacific Coast, from the Gulf of Fonseca in the north to the turquoise waters of Playa El Naranjo in the south.  Set to be completed in 2025, the ambitious new infrastructure project makes it much easier to shoot south from Nicaragua's sprawling capital, Managua, to the tropical forests and the world-class surf hubs of San Juan del Sur and Popoyo along the country's 50km-long Emerald Coast – which has been luring in-the-know backpackers for years. More importantly, the Costanera is aiming to breathe new economic life into the nation, which is one of the poorest in the Western hemisphere and views its growing tourism sector as key to its economic growth. After learning to ride a wave at a locally owned surf camp and sleeping in a treehouse tucked inside a rainforest, venture to the Refugio de Vida Silvestre La Flor at the highway's southern tip, where thousands of endangered olive ridley and leatherback turtles lay their eggs between September and October in a once-in-a-lifetime experience. – Eliot Stein Despite being ringed on all sides by the UK – Northern Ireland to the west, Scotland to the north, England to the east and Wales to the south – this cliff-fringed island isn't actually part of the Commonwealth. Instead, the self-governing isle is said to be ruled by the world's oldest continuous parliament, the Tynwald, and it's committed to preserving its distinct character and developing a sustainable tourism model. Awash with ancient historical sites, such as Cashtal yn Ard (\"Castle of the Height\", the largest Neolithic tomb in the British Isles) and Castle Rushen (one of the most complete medieval structures in Europe), the 85,000-resident island is decidedly forward-thinking. In 2016 it was recognised as a Unesco Biosphere (the world's only self-governing territory whose entire land and sea area has such designation) for its commitment to environmental preservation and cultural heritage. This year, witness the isle's spectacular native bird species at the new Manx Birdlife Point of Ayre National Reserve, which opened to the public in July 2024. Also on tap for 2025 is the 175th anniversary of Okell's Brewery, so celebrate this iconic Manx brew by partaking in tasting tours that will be held throughout the year. In addition to learning a few words in Manx Gaelic (the island's historical language) and familiarising yourself with the Manx pound (the island's unique currency), one of the best ways to understand this unique British Crown Dependency is to explore it on foot. Taking advantage of the isle's myriad of organised walking events, hikers will find rolling English fields, misty Irish hills and craggy Welsh coastlines – as well as dramatic Scottish Highland-esque peaks on the Isle's highest point, Snaefell mountain. On a clear day, trekkers can turn in a circle on its wind-whipped summit to see each country in the UK and Ireland. – Lynn Brown Pakistan is one of the world's most populated nations, yet it remains one of the great surprises for travellers. That may soon change, as the country is hoping a slew of responsible tourism initiatives and new sustainable efforts will lure eco-conscious visitors to explore its breathtaking northern regions; home to five of the planet's 14 peaks towering over 8,000m – including the world's second highest, K2. Salam Pakistan (Pakistan's first-ever national tourism brand, which launched in 2023) allows travellers to easily apply for e-visas and make bookings on the digital platform, including the coveted mountaineering and trekking visa. It only takes a quick glance at the list of mountain peaks and treks to see the scale of Pakistan's unmatched adrenaline opportunities. Yet, Pakistan is much more than staggering mountain trails. The scenic Gilgit-Baltistan region – dubbed \"heaven's gate\" – is brimming with lush valleys, pristine lakes and glacial waterfalls. Cradled between trails are the Hunza Valley's fragrant cherry blossoms and apricot orchards, undulating Unesco-listed Deosai plains and Shangri-La-esque mirrored lakes. Venture towards the Pakistan-China border to find the Khunjerab Pass, which will be operational year-round starting in 2025. – Aysha Imtiaz Marooned in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean some 1,500km west of Lisbon, this nine-island Portuguese archipelago is one of Europe's most isolated destinations and is known for its steaming natural hot springs, jewel-coloured lakes and sparkling lava tubes. The Azores already boast some of the continent's most dramatic black-sand beaches and best whale-watching opportunities, but the islands can now add another superlative to the list: Europe's largest protected marine sanctuary. In a groundbreaking piece of legislation approved in October 2024, the Azores' newly designated Marine Protected Area will extend 287,000 sq km (an expanse larger than all of Great Britain) and safeguard deep-sea corals, sharks and the 28 species of whales and dolphins found here. Protecting the long-term health and biodiversity of these coral reefs will be a boon for travellers eager to participate in whale-watching and sustainable marine research expeditions in the years to come. Elsewhere, a scenic drive from the capital of Ponta Delgada, Furnas Valley is home to two active volcanoes. Spend some time hot spring hopping your way across the bubbling geothermal valley, wander through lush botanical gardens or enjoy a leisurely stroll in Terra Nostra Park, arguably one of Europe's most beautiful parks. Dating back to 1775, the eponymous Terra Nostra Garden Hotel is a bonafide green retreat that will offer guests 24-hour access to their newly enhanced thermal pools and jacuzzis starting in January 2025. Don't leave without sampling the cozido das Furnas – a local meat stew buried underground and slow-cooked using the volcanic hot springs' natural heat. Nearby, sample purple volcanic tea at Chalet da Tia Mercês, or plan a visit to the family-owned Gorreana Tea Factory, the oldest (and only) tea plantation in Europe. – Michelle Gross Kansas City, Missouri is making 2025 its glow-up year. The city heretofore known as \"Paris of the Plains\" is busily promoting its creative arts scene and status as one of North America's barbeque capitals, all while launching an urban revitalisation plan that includes new museums, entertainment districts and hotels. At the heart of the rebrand is the Museum of BBQ, the world's first museum dedicated to the art of smoked meat. Slated to open at the Crown Center shopping district in spring 2025, the immersive experience will delve into Kansas City's deep barbeque culture, leading visitors through interactive exhibits culminating in a gift shop selling all manner of BBQ goods. The Berkley Riverfront will continue to see new dining experiences, shops and apartment buildings among its incoming development. The Kansas City International Airport completed significant renovations in 2023, with the $1.5bn expansion replacing outdated terminals and improving passenger flow. This year will also see upgrades to the KC Streetcar; a 3.5-mile Main Street extension expected to open this summer that will make it even easier to reach some of the city's premier destinations, including the Union Hill shopping district and the National WWI Museum and Memorial – home to the world's most comprehensive collection of World War One objects and documents. And when Rock Island Bridge re-opens in spring 2025, it will become the site of a new entertainment district ­set 40ft feet over a river. – Eva Sandoval Even if you've already stargazed at the spacelike Uyuni salt flats (the world's largest) and trekked breathlessly around the hilly capital of La Paz (the world's highest), Bolivia is worth a visit in 2025. This August marks the country's 200th anniversary and it's celebrating with events and attractions throughout the year in the capitals of its nine regions. Visit from 24 February to 5 March for the Oruro Carnival, which includes a multi-day folk-dance parade and has earned Unesco Heritage status for preserving oral tradition. In Potosí, sip a bicentennial singani (Bolivia's answer to Peru's pisco). This strong spirit, now a symbol of national pride, is said to have started viticulture in the region in the 1500s in what was once a booming mining town – and Potosí still has the colonial architecture to prove it. Bolivia has the largest proportion of Indigenous people in South America, with roughly two-thirds of the population directly related to the area's original inhabitants. Bolivia's prettiest city, Chuquisaca (also called Sucre), where the declaration of independence was signed in 1825, is home to many Quechua peoples. While there, be suer to visit the Museo de Arte Indígena for an up-close look at the country's ancient textile tradition. The Aymara people of the altiplano welcome visitors to the Isla del Sol (an island in the middle of Lake Titicaca) whose moonlike terrain makes for an incredible daylong hike. Elsewhere, a new network of community-based tourism brings attractions (and work opportunities) to these sometimes-remote communities, such as the Chalalan Ecolodge in the Amazon's Madidi National Park, where capybaras, cougars and macaws make their homes. – Laura Norkin Botswana has been hailed as Africa's leader in green safari tourism due to its expansive wildlife reserves and the government's focus on high-income, low-impact ecotourism policies; a strategy that has traditionally meant allowing fewer tourists. But as the country ushers in a new government and continues to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, its tourism sector (and sustainable cache) only stands to grow in 2025, with an increased demand for sustainable and culturally immersive travel experiences. In a bid to bolster tourism and strengthen the economy, Botswana has granted visa-free entry to visitors from 104 countries in recent years – including those from the US, UK, Germany and Canada. This means more travellers can now explore Botswana's natural beauty, including the \"Elephant Capital of the World\", Chobe National Park, and the Unesco-listed Okavango Delta; a vast wetland in the Kalahari Desert that is one of the world's last havens for cheetahs and the black rhinoceros. The Okavango Delta will also see a number of new openings, including the 100% solar-powered Mbamba Camp in the delta's lagoon-and-savannah-dotted north, a luxury lodge offering a blend of comfort and family-friendly wildlife adventures that's slated to open in April 2025. Opening in May 2025 is Monachira Camp, where visitors can enjoy walking safaris, mokoro canoe rides and armchair safaris while coming face to face with elephants, lions and the Pel's Fishing Owl. Starting in April 2025, new Air Botswana routes will connect Gaborone to Cape Town, making it even easier for visitors to explore Botswana's magical nature for themselves – sustainably. – Eva Sandoval \"Is it even a city?\" a recent viral ad for Oslo, Norway asked. The tongue-in-cheek video nodded to how overtourism has sullied other European capitals while showcasing the Norwegian capital's extreme walkability; world-class dining; and easy access to nearby fjords, islands and serene postcard-perfect landscapes. Known for its modern architecture, sweeping waterfront and no shortage of trees (it's one of Europe's most-forested cities), Oslo is luring the kinds of visitors who will do their part to ensure that it remains one of the world's most sustainable cities. Visitors here are encouraged to refer to the Visit Oslo Responsibly guidelines and the Green Oslo Guide, which break down the concept of sustainable tourism into four categories: planet, people, prosperity and partnership. It's not unusual for hotels in the city centre to feature green roofs that produce food, reduce energy use, manage rainwater and support urban biodiversity. Travellers can ensure their visit has a positive impact on residents and the local environment by supporting local businesses like the Norwegian Adventure Company, which offers \"life-changing and sustainable experiences\" from its base in Oslo, like kayaking through glacier-carved fjords, and chasing the Northern Lights. After a long day of exploring the spectacular Nordic countryside, dine at one of the city's many farm-to-table restaurants, like the Michelin-starred Maaemo, which utilises locally grown organic produce. So, is it even a city?

The airline issued the statement to the BBC on Friday, after the couple told Australia's Channel Nine that they were traumatised by the experience on the Melbourne to Doha flight. Qatar Airways had apologised in a previous statement for \"any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused\". The incident sparked debate over procedures on dealing with deaths aboard planes. Mitchell Ring and Jennifer Colin, who were travelling to Venice for a holiday, said the cabin crew had placed the dead woman, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the last four hours of a 14-hour flight. The woman collapsed then died along the aisle beside them. Afterwards, the crew tried but failed to move her body to the business class section because \"she was quite large lady and they couldn't get her through the aisle\", Mr Ring said. They then asked Mr Ring to move over and placed the lady in the seat he was in. While Ms Colin was invited by another passenger to sit beside her across the aisle, Mr Ring said the plane's staff did not offer to move him elsewhere even though there were vacant seats around. Qatar Airways said on Friday that the crew's handling of the woman's death was \"in line with training and industry standard practice\". \"Passengers were accommodated to other seats, and a crew member was sitting at all times with the deceased passenger for the duration of the flight until landing in Doha,\" its statement said. \"It is an unfortunate reality that unexpected deaths do sometimes occur on board aircraft across the aviation industry and our crew are highly trained to deal with these situations with as much respect and dignity as possible.\" The airline also said that they have offered support and compensation to the family of the deceased and other passengers who were directly affected by the incident. \"We totally understand that we can't hold the airline responsible for the poor lady's death, but surely after that there has to be a protocol to look after the customers on board,\" Ms Colin said in the televised interview with Channel 9. When the plane landed, Mr Ring said passengers were asked to stay put while medical staff and police came on board. Ambulance officers then started pulling blankets off the woman and he saw her face, he said. \"I can't believe they told us to stay,\" he said, adding that he thought they would have let the passengers leave the plane first before letting medical staff handle the body. Barry Eustance, a former Virgin Atlantic captain, earlier told the BBC that in his experience \"the crew would normally try to isolate the body, so there is no passenger exposure to the body and vice versa, for respect and privacy but also for medical reasons\". According to the guidelines by the International Air Transport Association on dealing with deaths on board a flight, the deceased person should be moved to a seat, preferably one with few other passengers nearby, and covered with a blanket or body bag up to the neck. The body could also moved to another area that does not obstruct an aisle or exit. Upon landing, the association recommends that other passengers disembark before the body is attended to by local authorities. Additional reporting by Fan Wang.

        "content": "A second runway at Gatwick Airport has been backed by government, providing measures to reduce noise are put in place. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"minded to approve\" the expansion. Some MPs, local authorities and residents are strongly opposed. The airport wants to move its northern runway, which is currently only used for taxiing or as a back up, and make it operational by the end of the decade. The transport secretary's support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission. If permission is granted, work would start almost immediately, the BBC understands. The £2.2bn expansion will be funded through private investment. \"I am issuing a minded to approve decision that provides some additional time to seek views from all parties on the provisions, prior to a final decision,\" Alexander said in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday. Gatwick has until 24 April to respond to demands for it to include measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport, in its overall plans before a final decision will be made in October. Stewart Wingate, Gatwick Airport chief executive, said following the latest announcement that the government has \"outlined a clear pathway to full approval later in the year\" and that the airport would \"engage fully\" in the process. The Transport Secretary's support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month. Gatwick, in West Sussex, is Europe's busiest single runway airport, with more than 40 million passengers using it last year. On Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was \"not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior\". The growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade. An extra runway at Gatwick would see capacity increased for holidaymakers and business travellers, particularly for short-haul destinations, as opposed to Heathrow's longer-haul flights. Gatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is \"full\". Being able to use both runways could increase the number of departures by 50,000 a year by the end of the 2030s, the airport argued. It said some 30,000 of those flights are planned to depart from the north runway which will only be used for departures and not landings. But there is strong opposition to any expansion, particularly from climate campaigners. Greenpeace UK policy director Douglas Parr said the extension would not drive economic growth. \"The only thing it's set to boost is air pollution, noise, and climate emissions,\" he added. Alex Chapman, senior economist at left-of-centre think tank New Economics Foundation, also argued the move would not create new jobs, but would just shift them from other parts of the country. \"People are already perfectly able to catch cheap flights on holiday or travel for business,\" he added. Union Unite general secretary Sharon Graham backed Gatwick having a second runway, but warned it would need \"to come with guarantees of well paid, unionised jobs and proper facilities for workers\". Bronwen Jones, development director at Gatwick, said a second runway would be \"a win for everyone\". She said it would create more flight slots across both runways. \"That allows us to offer new routes, new airlines, more frequencies on existing routes, so that passengers have more choice.\" Sally Pavey, chair of Communities Against Gatwick Noise Emissions (CAGNE), is worried about \"uncontrollable noise, ramifications on the roads, decline in air quality... and climate change\". \"We can't keep ignoring climate change and it would be wrong to allow a new 'bucket and spade' runway, as we put it, at the expense of residents and the economy,\" she said. The group would take legal action through a judicial review if the expansion goes ahead, she added. Gatwick said it has committed to reducing noise levels to below those of 2019 - which CAGNE says was one of the worst years for noise. On Wednesday the government's independent advisers, the UK climate change committee (UKCCC), recommended that to meet the country's climate goals the amount of planet-warming gases released by the country's aviation sector needed to fall by 17% compared to 2003 levels. Some of the pollution from flying, it said, could be reduced by switching planes to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and by capturing the planet-warming gases released. But experts think it could be challenging to obtain the feedstock, like corn grain or food waste, needed to make SAF. The UKCCC said the best way to reduce the industry's impact on climate change would be to significantly slow the demand for flying. At current levels demand is expected to grow by 53% by 2040, while the UKCCC says this should be closer to 16%.

A Jump Air flight from Southampton was on the approach to Guernsey Airport in August when it descended below the minimum height allowed during poor visibility. The report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) found there was confusion between the pilot and co-pilot which resulted in delays to the plane making a climb. It then diverted and landed safely back at Southampton Airport. The AAIB said the operator had taken a number of safety actions since the incident. Guernsey airline Aurigny said the flight was being operated by Jump Air - an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance (ACMI) or \"wet lease\" provider. A spokesman said this was commonplace and typically used by airlines to increase capacity during peak periods or when its fleet capacity is impacted. It added: \"We are encouraged by the report findings that Jump Air has implemented a number of changes since the incident. \"We are very glad all those involved are safe and the safety and welfare of our customers and crew is always our priority.

        "content": "Residents across the South East have expressed mixed views to a second runway at Gatwick Airport being backed by the government. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"minded to approve\" the expansion, providing measures to reduce noise were put in place. Ian Brooker, who lives near Three Bridges, in West Sussex, said he was in favour of the plans due to the additional jobs it could bring to the area. Meanwhile, campaign group Communities Against Gatwick Noise Emissions (Cagne) said: \"We will continue to hold Gatwick's feet to the fire to ensure the local communities of Sussex, Surrey and Kent do not pay for this burden, as well as the planet.\" Mr Brooker said Gatwick Airport was the main employer in the area. \"The more people that work there, the better,\" he said. But Cathy Barclay, from Charlwood, Surrey, said there was a \"fairly strong belief\" in the area that another runway was not needed. \"If you think of the road and the rail and the housing, everything that supports the infrastructure here, it's tight enough as it is now,\" she said. \"It would be horrendous.\" Julie Jones, who owns 52 The Street Cafe in Charlwood, says the extra runway is not needed. \"There are other areas of England that are in desperate need of further infrastructure in their own towns and cities, Charlwood actually isn't one of them,\" she explained. Peter Barclay, who is chairman of the Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign (GACC), says he is glad to see the decision pushed back. \"We're pushing once again to a victory because we've had six attempts at an additional runway at Gatwick so far and we've beaten five and we're going to beat the sixth one,\" he said. The campaign chairman said it was \"highly questionable\" that the second runway could be brought into use in a \"satisfactory way\". Mr Barclay explained: \"You can't get rid of the environment impacts. \"Its our lives, its our future lives, its our children, our grandchildren, everybody's lives [that could be impacted].\" He said the group was challenging the plans on behalf of local communities. Charlwood resident John Shelley said: \"It's dreadful, the concept of putting a full working second runway in such a rural area with such small roads, such small infrastructure, it's just ridiculous.\" He added: \"We've been going so long, trying to keep Charlwood this wonderful rural community, and where's it going to go?\" Penny Shoubridge, who also lives in the village, says a second runway would make an \"enormous difference\" as some residents are already impacted by the noise. \"That has a hugely detrimental impact on our health, on our sleeping,\" she explained. Rachel Martin, who lives under a flight path in Horley, says she thinks another runway could make flights more noticeable for those living in the area. She added that residents would \"just have to put up with it if it goes ahead\". The transport secretary's support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission.

Gatwick Airport has until 24 April to respond to demands for it to include measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport, in its overall plans before a final decision is made in October. Cagne added that it welcomed the extension of the deadline until October as it believed \"planning hearings left so many questions unanswered\". Meanwhile, union Unite backed the airport having a second runway, but warned it would need \"to come with guarantees of well paid, unionised jobs and proper facilities for workers\".

        "content": "With season three of The White Lotus drawing fresh waves of visitors to the already bustling shores of Phuket and Koh Samui, a very different story is unfolding across the Gulf of Thailand. As season three of The White Lotus prepares to thrust Thailand's islands into the global spotlight, drawing fresh waves of visitors to the already bustling shores of Phuket and Koh Samui, a very different story is unfolding across the Gulf of Thailand. Here, a speck of an island named Koh Mak has quietly positioned itself as a model for sustainable tourism, offering a rare vision of what the future of travel in Thailand could be. Heading towards Koh Mak's southern shores by speedboat, my first impression was disarmingly simple: golden sand curving into clear shallows while coconut palms leaned towards the sea as though caught mid-bow. There were no high-rises, no blaring beach clubs. Instead, low-slung bungalows peeked through the trees and bicycles outnumbered cars on the island's quiet roads. I checked into the Makathanee Resort next to the jetty and studied a map to get my bearings. Just 16 sq km in size, Koh Mak is flat apart from a few gentle hills, perfect for exploring by bike. Eager to tap into the island's slow rhythm, I pedalled north-east through plantations of rubber trees and coconut palms to Laem Son beach. Here, I found little more than a shack made of coconut trunks and fronds and a few deck chairs facing a blissfully empty stretch of sand. I ordered a coconut shake and enjoyed a delicious half hour soaking up the silence before heading across to the settlement of Ao Suan Yai. Even here, there was little to detract from the island's natural beauty, just several tastefully designed, low-key resorts tucked away behind a white-sand beach and a line of palms all leaning at the same angle towards the sea. As I completed my brief tour, I was amazed to realise that during my bike ride I had seen no international hotels or shopping malls, no McDonalds or KFCs and not a single 7-Eleven, which seem to be on every street corner throughout the rest of Thailand. Promoted by the Tourist Authority of Thailand (TAT) as the country's first low-carbon destination, Koh Mak has become a testing ground for how small islands can thrive without sacrificing their soul to mass tourism. Unlike its larger, better-known neighbours ­– party-friendly Koh Chang to the north and exclusive Koh Kood to the south – Koh Mak is charting a slower, quieter course. Its approach, driven by the island's long-time landowning families, has earned international recognition for sustainable tourism. But it is the lived reality that truly sets it apart. This is not an island clinging to an imagined past; it's one that is actively shaping a different kind of future. Green Getaways Green Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world. While many Thai islands fall under the jurisdiction of the Thai government, Koh Mak remains in the hands of five families, descendants of a civil servant named Luang Prompakdee who purchased the island's coconut plantations in the early 20th Century. Yodchai Sudhidhanakul, president of the Koh Mak Tourism Club and one of Prompakdee's descendants, told me that this tight-knit ownership structure has been key to protecting the island's tranquil character and encouraging slow tourism. \"It's not that we don't want tourists; in fact, many residents depend on tourism,\" Sudhidhanakul said. \"But we hope to attract a particular type of visitor – those who are respectful of others and appreciate the benefits of a quiet life.\" In 2018, residents formalised their vision in the Koh Mak Charter. The agreement bans vehicle ferries from docking at the island, restricts motorbike rentals to 70% of room capacity, prohibits loud music after 22:00 and noisy water sports like jet skis, and bans the use of foam or plastic containers. When to visit Koh Mak Koh Mak's high season is between November and April. In the low season (May to October), the island is almost deserted although boats still make the journey. Some resorts close at this time but those that remain open offer cheaper rates. \"We never worried about overtourism,\" said Sudhidhankul, \"as our available accommodation has remained at a steady 750 rooms, but we wanted to be part of the low-carbon initiative. Thus, most resort owners use renewable energy where possible and make efforts to recycle and dispose of waste responsibly.\" This ethos extends beyond policy. Local initiatives like the Koh Mak Coral Conservation Group offer snorkelling trips where visitors can learn how to propagate corals using recycled PVC pipes. Waste disposal is a collective effort, with regular beach cleanups coordinated by Trash Hero, a voluntary group with the motto, \"Every week we clean, we educate, we change\". And at the island's coconut plantation, visitors can learn how to harvest coconuts and make cold-pressed coconut oil, while tie-dye workshops teach traditional fabric-dyeing techniques using natural pigments.

Unfortunately, most of what I found would only be of interest to the Trash Heroes – plastic bottles, old shoes and torn fishing nets. There were plenty of other activities to choose from, including diving and snorkelling trips, kayaking, paddle boarding, classes in massage and cooking, Thai boxing and yoga. How to go green on Koh Mak • Rent a bicycle or golf cart to explore the island • Join the Trash Heroes on Saturday morning for their weekly cleanup • Eat local rather than imported food • Sign up for a long stay at the Koh Mak Campus • Join in any of the eco-friendly activities on offer I took part in a game of disc golf (aka frisbee golf) and joined a tie-dyeing workshop, where I made a shirt that gave me a great sense of accomplishment. Workshop leader Rodjamarn Sirirut showed us a display of more than 20 natural dyes made from local plants such as indigo, malabar, mango, mangosteen and coconut shell; impressive evidence of the island's natural diversity. These pursuits made a change from lounging at swim-up pool bars or stuffing myself at buffets as I might have done if I had been staying at an international resort. One day I joined a snorkelling trip to Koh Rang, an island to the west of Koh Mak that is part of the Koh Chang Marine National Park. On the boat I chatted with Rong Rong Zhu, a former research scientist in the US who now spends most of her time on Koh Mak. \"When I travelled in Asia in 2018, I found Koh Mak to be a very walkable and bike-friendly island,\" she said. \"I was able to rent a house with a beautiful view and now I have many digital nomad friends who spend half the year here.\" Koh Mak is not immune to the challenges facing small islands. Plastic debris still washes up on its shores, swept in by ocean currents. And while the island's co-working hub, Koh Mak Campus, set up by Sudhidhanakul in 2020, encourages longer stays and digital nomads, balancing tourism and development remains a delicate task. \"We want to attract seasonal inhabitants, and we need to develop more expertise in the use of renewable energy.\" Sudhidhanakul told me. Yet, as I slipped into the island's rhythm – cycling from one beach to another, sipping coconut shakes under palm trees and chatting with residents who spoke of their home with both pride and protectiveness – it became clear that Koh Mak offers something increasingly rare in Thailand. It is a reminder that a different kind of tourism is possible, one that doesn't require sacrificing a place's spirit for progress. As the speedboat carried me back towards the busy mainland, I found myself hoping that Koh Mak's quiet revolution might inspire others to follow its lead. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Designated as a Dark Sky Preserve in 2011 by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC) and spanning 11,000 sq km of protected land where minimal to no light pollution is allowed, Jasper isn't just one of the best places to stargaze; it's also an ideal spot to see the Northern Lights. And as experts predict that 2025 \"will mesmerise\" with one of the greatest aurora displays in 20 years, there's never been a better time to explore this quiet corner of the Canadian Rockies. Unlike other Dark Sky Preserves in Canada and the US like Wood Buffalo National Park and Grasslands National Park that have little to no infrastructure or lodging, the eponymous 4,700-person town of Jasper – located within the preserve – allows travellers easy stargazing access. According to Tyler Burgardt, an astrophysicist and general manager of the Jasper Planetarium, what makes Jasper so unique is visitors can drive right in. Located roughly 3.5 hours from Edmonton and Calgary, the town's hotels and locally led stargazing tours means star-lovers don't need to rough it. \"You get to see something you don't get in other [accessible] places, which is the ability to see thousands of stars, even from the middle of town,\" Burgardt said. His favourite tour is one offered in summer, where guests visit the planetarium and then take a twilight stroll down to a peninsula located on Lac Beauvert. Ringed by rugged peaks and hauntingly silent, the only sound you may hear is the soft ripple of wind on the water. Burgardt estimates the Northern Lights are visible here roughly every 10 days to two weeks. \"It's just absolutely beautiful,\" he said. \"It's a really cool way to truly experience the nighttime side of the Canadian Rockies.\" The quaint, alpine community is committed to ensuring that minimal artificial lighting is visible by installing streetlights that point downwards and have a softer glow than regular lights. As Burgardt notes, Jasper's location within the national park, and surrounded by the Unesco-designated Canadian Rocky Mountains, also provides a natural barrier from the artificial light created by nearby cities. According to the RASC, the goal of a dark sky designation in a community is to promote \"low-impact lighting practices, to improve the nocturnal environment for plants and wildlife, to protect and expand dark observing sites for astronomy and to provide accessible locations for naturalists and the general public to experience the naturally dark night sky\". Phillipa Gunn, public relations and communications officer for Parks Canada, said Jasper National Park initially met some of the requirements from the RASC needed to become a Dark Sky Preserve prior to its official designation, including accessible observation sites where visitors can view the sky. \"Jasper National Park is an ideal location for a Dark Sky Preserve as 97% of the park is a designated wilderness area, free of light pollution,\" Gunn said. Parks Canada has also continued to expand its dark sky interpretation programmes, while working with the town and private partners to ensure all the street fixtures in the townsite are dark-sky compliant. As a result, when driving to Jasper at night, it's nearly impossible to tell a town is even located in the vast blackness that envelopes the area. In July 2024, a series of devastating fires ripped through Jasper, causing the \"jewel of the Rockies\" to close for several months. The park reopened last autumn in time for the Jasper Dark Sky Festival – albeit just on a smaller scale. But with 2025 marking the festival's 15th anniversary, Naji Khouri, director of destination development for Tourism Jasper, says this year's festival will be bigger than ever before. Plans include a drone show where 200 synchronised drones put on a light display, notable guest speakers (Bill Nye has previously attended), planetarium stargazing sessions and a portable telescope and tent at the base of the Jasper Sky Tram. \"We invite space or science enthusiasts, aurora chasers and anyone that is fascinated by the dark sky and wants to learn more about it. We have unique experiences that are really of interest to a wide range of people, including families,\" said Khouri. And locals want people to know that Jasper isn't only open for the Dark Sky Festival, but for business as usual, with more than 80% of local businesses back open since the blaze. After hiking the Sulphur Skyline trail to experience sweeping views of the Fiddle River Valley and Utopia Mountain, paddling on the \"pearl necklace\" that is Maligne Lake or exploring the Pyramid Lake Overlook by day, visitors should also seek out stories of the stars from an Indigenous and cultural lens. The Indigenous people of Canada have long utilised the night sky in all aspects of daily life: the stars and constellations served as guiding lights for their ancestors and the sky was used as both a clock and calendar, indicating when to plant, hunt and work the land. The stars are also intrinsically linked to First Nations' spiritual identities and are connected to the legends of the past. Matricia Bauer of Warrior Women, an Indigenous- and women-owned business run by Bauer and her daughter, offers a fireside stargazing tour in Jasper that is based around Indigenous creation stories. Being of Cree descent, Bauer recognised the importance of decolonising her own education and that included learning about the Cree Star Chart and the Indigenous constellations that came to rest in the kisik (sky), in Cree. \"[The Cree Star Chart] made sense of the world around me, it made sense of the Northern Lights,\" she said. \"I understood who Star Woman was. I understood why we come from the stars and why we return to the stars.\" In Cree culture, there are different Star Beings, and Star Woman is one of them. According to Bauer, Star Woman saw the Earth – where humans lived – and she gave up her Star Being to come to \"Turtle Island\" (North America) . When she became pregnant with twins, this was the start of the First People. At the end of her life, she was granted three wishes and one of the wishes was that she could return to the sky. More like this: • The Indigenous tribes reclaiming travel • The only land disputed between the US and Canada • The last places on Earth to see truly dark starry nights \"And so, when we see the Northern Lights, we call that the Cipayuk,\" said Bauer. \"It means ancestors dancing, or ghosts dancing. It's reminding us that there is another realm that exists, that we get to stay in for the rest of our lives. It's when we go back to the Star World where we came from.\" As Bauer recants stories with songs, she also tells me about Spider Woman, the one who is weaving our fates in the dark sky that soars above us. She then recounts the story of the coyote, tricking the wolves and bears into the sky so that he could create his own constellation. A story that takes place in winter, to be told in winter, when the days are short, the nights are long and the fire becomes a place to gather. To Bauer and many First Nations residents in and around Jasper, the stars, also known as achakosak, are considered relatives: \"Every constellation, every star has a beautiful song, has a beautiful story, has a beautiful place in our culture.\" There are many more stories that Bauer wants to tell for visitors, and many more conversations to still be had under the black cloak of Jasper's night sky. The snap, crackle and pop of the fire is an accompanying beat to the drum that she plays, and her voice dances towards the place where she knows she will one day return. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "As White Lotus season three is released, executive producer Mark Kamine explains the behind-the-scenes wrangling and key challenges when choosing a filming location. It's being called the \"White Lotus effect\": the way that major TV shows influence the way we travel, thanks to the hit TV show that's back on 16 February 2025. The black comedy-drama, written by Mike White, is in a new location for a third season, following the guests and staff of fictional five-star resort, the White Lotus. The dark drama satirises the excesses of the rich, set against the struggles of the staff, in a glamorous setting. It's thrilling, pacey stuff with beautiful people, gripping action and a tense setup that tells you from episode one, that although this looks like paradise, something terrible is going to happen. In the first season, a coffin is unloaded from a plane; while in the second, a body is discovered floating in the sea by a guest. Season three's trailer is peppered with shots of guns and whispers of body bags amid the palm trees and luxury spa treatments. Despite the gory details and the lampooning of the rich, everyone wants to stay at the White Lotus. When it was announced mid 2024 that Thailand would be the location for the TV show's third season, global interest in travel to the country soared, with booking platforms reporting immediate increases in searches, and airlines including Finnair adding extra weekly flights to Phuket. Hotels.com reported a 40% spike in booking interest for the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui, one of the filming locations. The expectations come with a precedent: the Sicilian hotel, the Four Seasons San Domenico Palace in Taormina, Sicily, where season two was filmed, reported it was booked out for six months when it reopened after filming and continues to attract guests wanting a slice of the White Lotus lifestyle. The original White Lotus, the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea, Hawaii, said it saw a 425% uptick year on year in website visits and 386% increase in availability checks. The White Lotus isn't the first drama to have an outsized effect on the travel industry – the impact of films like Lord of the Rings and The Sound of Music on tourism has been well documented, as has the much-criticised Emily in Paris. But what's interesting right now, in the digital age, is how quickly news about a streamed TV show setting can have an impact. \"Back in 2015, research showed that around one in five people coming to Britain were coming because of something they'd seen on TV,\" said screen tourism specialist Seren Welch. \"Fast forward to now, and the latest Visit Britain research shows that nine in 10 visitors to the UK are influenced by what they have seen in film and TV. It's unheard of.\" This rise is down to the prevalence of streaming platforms: as Welch notes, 10 years ago, we didn't have Disney+ and Netflix was a lesser phenomenon. Today, streaming algorithms are powerful drivers of our behaviour far beyond the screen, with the opportunity to binge-watch everything anywhere leading viewers to be ever more immersed. \"I've heard a British Airways exec say that when they see a spike in traffic to a destination, they look at what's peaking on Netflix to explain it,\" Welch said. When it comes to planning a location for a TV show like The White Lotus, Mark Kamine knows a thing or two. Kamine, one of The White Lotus's executive producers, started his career as a location scout working on all six seasons of The Sopranos, along with film credits on Hollywood films including Ted, American Hustle and Silver Linings Playbook. His new book On Locations: Lessons Learned From my Life on Set with the Sopranos and in the Film Industry details the behind-the-scenes wrangling inherent in location work, from negotiating with strip club owners keen to do under-the-table deals, to pacifying home owners who have just found out you've staged a mafia killing in their house. It's a lively read, running through the behind-the-scenes production level details about how to make one destination stand in for another on the tightest of tight budgets. While many of Kamine's previous film and TV productions have had financial issues constraining filming locations, when it came to The White Lotus, the wild success of the first seasons meant that when deciding the location for season three, there was plenty of choice. \"Mike White had the idea for something around Eastern philosophy,\" Kamine explained. \"We were looking for what was practical and eye-catching, and to start with, Korea, Philippines, Japan, Bali and Sri Lanka were in the mix, as well as Thailand.\" Further discussion and research narrowed the choice to Japan and Thailand, with White and Kamine and others making research trips to see what would work best. (White typically stays in the resort to write and research the show ahead of production.) Kamine notes in his book that the key challenges faced by location scouts centre on budgets: productions often end up being shot in dupe locations, where, for example, Prague might stand in for New Jersey, because even when subsidised, US locations can't compete with European, Asian or African crew and material costs. But for a sure-fire hit like The White Lotus, which had a reported $38.5m budget for season two and drew in 4.1 million US viewers for its finale, Karmine and his team chose the option that reflected the story they wanted to tell best, rather than make a financial compromise. \"Mike said that he feels like we've cracked the code,\" Kamine admitted, \"in that we've figured out how to stay in these luxury locations and create great TV. What a life.\" The new series is filmed in the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui, with the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok, Anantara Mai Khao Phuket Villas and Anantara Bophut Koh Samui Resort also featured – along with a little creative licence. \"Anyone who has been to the Four Seasons in Sicily that we used in the show will know that the beach isn't where it seems to be,\" said Kamine. \"Some scenes in season three are shot at one hotel, and some aspects are filmed elsewhere. The common spaces need to have real impact, that's a driver here. Overall, the main thing is that it looks beautiful.\" The White Lotus team are aware of the impact the filming has on future bookings and the local tourism scene. Kamine says he keeps in touch with the hotel managers from the previous series and is aware of the debate around overtourism, noting that these popular five-star locations already have existing tourism infrastructure and have been developed to handle a certain number of visitors. More like this: • White Lotus 3 Thailand filming locations revealed • The White Lotus season three review • 'Set-jetting': How on-screen locations are becoming travel destinations However, given that films shot in Thailand have driven a surge of tourism in the past – the extreme popularity of The Beach caused Maya Bay to close, for instance – it's somewhat surprising to find that Thailand has no plan in place to mitigate a potential tourism surge from the show. A spokesperson from Tourism Thailand noted that the country is still trying to build back its tourism industry following Covid, and that since the show airs in Thailand's shoulder season, it is most likely to boost tourism numbers in these quieter months when there is more capacity than in peak season. The White Lotus isn't the only streaming show boosting holiday bookings. As set-jetting continues to be a popular motif in the travel industry, new series including Yellowstone prequel 1923, set in Montana, are expected to drive more tourism. It's not without its problems: in 2023, The Washington Post reported that Yellowstone has driven tourism to the region but has brought with it misconceptions: it does rain, it can be cold, and not everyone is as well dressed as the show would have you believe. That's showbusiness. Season two of Wednesday, also releasing this year, is a good case in point: the show is set in a fictional town in Vermont but season one was shot in Romania and season two filmed in Ireland. The final season of Stranger Things will air later this year as well, set in the town of Hawkins, Indiana but filmed in Jackson, Georgia. It's a known filming location – The Walking Dead and The Vampire Diaries were also shot there – and the local tourism authority already has information on how to follow the shows around town. Tellingly, it notes that \"the upside down is NOT included\". As for The White Lotus, now that season three is out, thoughts are turning to season four. Kamine wouldn't confirm or deny any location currently under discussion for the next series but did let slip that one thing is important: going back perhaps to his Soprano days, it needs to be somewhere where it's easy to dump a body. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "This more remote part of Iceland offers visitors a deep dive into its fascinating history and authentic culture. Iceland wasn't always the blockbuster travel destination it is today; in the early 1990s, the country saw just a little more than 130,000 visitors a year. By 2023, however that number had surged to 2.21 million, far outpacing Iceland's tiny population of around 380,000. Experts chalk it up to a mix of savvy marketing, social media virality and sheer natural spectacle. The 2014 #MyStopover campaign turned layovers into week-long adventures, flooding Instagram with images of steaming hot springs, glacier lagoons and volcanic black-sand beaches. Soon, Iceland was no longer just a niche destination for intrepid explorers; it was on every traveller's bucket list. But with soaring popularity came new challenges, pushing the country to grapple with the pressures of overtourism. Most visitors touch down in the capital city of Reykjavik and make a beeline for the Blue Lagoon or the well-trodden Golden Circle. But as Iceland's tourism boom shows no signs of slowing, the country is looking for ways to ease the strain on its most popular spots. The conversation around overtourism has become impossible to ignore, and one solution is clear: encouraging travellers to venture beyond the usual highlights. The country's north, with its dramatic fjords and geothermal hotspots, offers a quieter yet equally spectacular alternative to the capital, with idyllic towns like Akureyri and Húsavík providing a gateway to breathtaking landscapes without the crowds. Húsavík is the country's oldest settlement as well as its whale capital. The small coastal town was once known for its whaling industry, and indeed Iceland is still one of only three countries that allows commercial whaling. However, many former whale hunting boats are now being converted to whale watching vessels in an effort to attract more visitors. \"I've been told there's a 97% chance of seeing a whale on any trip you take here,\" said BBC Travel Show presenter Roma Wells. \"Depending on what time of year you visit, you can see all sorts of different species.\" That's because a variety of whales, including humpbacks, orcas and minkes, migrate through this area. In addition, many whale-watching vessels use electric rather than diesel engines, creating a quieter, more relaxing experience for both passengers and sealife. The northern part of the country is also a great place to get a glimpse of Icelandic history and culture. Start in the town of Sauðárkrókur, around 200km west of Húsavík, visitors can explore 1238: The Battle of Iceland – a museum and virtual-reality experience that allows visitors to be a part of the renowned battle of Örlygsstaðir, which is recounted in one of the country's most famous Icelandic sagas. The exhibition also includes historical items from the 11th Century that provide tangible proof of the country's Viking past. More like this: • The only place where whales come to watch you • Iceland's First Lady takes you on a tour of her super chill nation • Five extraordinary night-time experiences around the world \"Every generation has the responsibility to preserve history and to mediate it in a way that can be understood,\" said museum manager Freyja Rut. \"I think we've come to the next step. We need to use technology to kind of make it more interesting.\" Another piece of Iceland's history is its iconic turf houses. These grass-covered dwellings, inspired by Viking longhouses, blend seamlessly into the landscape like something out of a fairy tale. Built with wood and stone and insulated with thick layers of turf, they stand as a testament to the resilience of Icelanders who found ingenious ways to survive in an unforgiving climate. The north is home to some of the country's finest examples, including the Glaumbær turf farm, a cluster of beautifully preserved homes, and the striking Víðimýri Turf Church. Sheep farming and knitting are also central to Icelandic heritage. The region's hardy, free-roaming sheep – believed to be direct descendants of those brought by Viking settlers – produce the wool used for Iceland's famous lopapeysa sweaters. Recognised worldwide for their warmth and distinctive circular yoke patterns, these sweaters are a living connection to Iceland's pastoral traditions that remain a cornerstone of rural life. \"Icelandic people only survived here because of the sheep,\" quipped Hélène Magnússonis, one of the country's leading knit designers. Visitors interested in purchasing an authentic lopapeysa sweater should look for a label that says \"Handknitted in Iceland\" – a mark of quality that according to Magnússonis, often includes the knitter's name. Operators such as Green EdVentures offer tours where travellers can learn more about Icelandic life and practice their knitting skills with a local lopapeysa expert. Along with the boost in tourism, Iceland has had to wrestle with environmental degradation and unsafe behaviours from visitors, such as taking selfies too close to active volcanic sites. In 2017, the country proposed the Icelandic pledge, which encourages responsible and considerate behaviour in visitors. The hope is that the combination of this pledge and the push to encourage visitors to explore more of the country will help Iceland remain on the top of everyone's visitor list, without further damage to the local ecosystem or culture. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "As tensions between the US and Canada rise, a tiny puffin-filled island has become emblematic of a larger conflict about where one nation ends and another begins. On Christmas morning, Anthony Ross woke up on an island at the point where the Gulf of Maine meets the Bay of Fundy. Outside, the wind whipped across the frozen brown grass, blowing snow in drifts against the lighthouse while waves lapped the rocky shore. In the next room, his older brother Russell was already awake and keeping a watchful eye on the sea. It was not exactly how one pictures a family holiday, but for the lighthouse keepers of Machias Seal Island, it would have to make do. Once the helicopter lands on this 18-acre hunk of rock between the US and Canada, there is no going home until the end of the month. “You are away from home for 28 days at a time; that is the hardest part. But you get used to that,” said Russell, who has been a lighthouse keeper for about 20 years. Luckily, Russell and Anthony came prepared with turkey, presents and beer – all anyone needs for a nice Christmas day. After decorating the tree and calling their families back home in Nova Scotia, the brothers tucked into a roast dinner. “It was a pretty good Christmas, all around,” Russell recalled. Located smack-dab between the Canadian province of New Brunswick and the US state of Maine, Machias Seal Island is the last contested land territory between Canada and the US – but that may soon change. In recent weeks US President Donald Trump has called the US-Canada border an \"artificially drawn line\" and even threatened to annex the entire nation. And as Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada have sent economic shockwaves through North America, this unassuming 20-acre island has become somewhat emblematic of the rising tensions between the neighbours and longtime allies. The story of the dispute goes back more than 200 years. During the War of 1812, Great Britain (now Canada) and the US each laid claim to the land and the waters that surrounded it. Although the island is far too small and remote to be permanently settled, it was strategically located in the middle of a valuable shipping route, near Grand Manan Island, and neither country wanted to give it away. In 1832, Britain built a lighthouse on the island to physically stake its claim. Since then, Canadians have been living there, helping keep sailors away from its rocky coastline and protecting the land from both human and natural foes. That is where Russell and Anthony come in. As lighthouse keepers on the island, they are part of a long line of watchmen manning Canada’s frontier in the Atlantic Ocean. While most of the lighthouses in Atlantic Canada have closed, the government has kept this one open – in part to keep its claim on the rock. “The opportunity we have to be here, to stay on here and man the island, it is important,” Anthony said. “There are not many light-keepers left.” Neither brother works full-time – union rules say that part-time keepers can only work three month-long shifts a year. But one full-time position may be opening up, and both Russell and Anthony want to go for it. “May the best man win,” Anthony said with a smile. Both brothers have been doing this long enough to know the island’s rhythms: the way it fades from emerald green to dusty brown with the seasons; how the puffins swoop and cackle when they spot a fish in the water; and how the lobster boats emerge from the horizon just after sunrise. “The boats are fishing right in the cove there – you can see all the fishermen,” Russell said. “I have been here long enough that they know my name now, they know my voice on the [radio], and they know me too.” Russell and Anthony also play a role as unofficial ambassadors for the island, greeting American and Canadian tour boats that dock during the summer, when the island turns into a seabird sanctuary. They treat everyone the same, no matter their nationality, offering the birdwatchers a hand onto the slippery, seaweed-covered boardwalk. “The birds do not care; they do not know the difference,” said Russell of the US-Canada border dispute As island guardians, Russell and Anthony play an important role in protecting the thousands of seabirds – Atlantic puffins, common murres, Arctic terns and razorbill auks – that nest here during the summer. They help deter gulls that would prey on the young chicks, and also fend off one of nature’s biggest homewreckers: man. As one of the largest seabird colonies on the East Coast – and the most diverse – the island is protected by Canadian Wildlife Services, which limits the number of tourists allowed on the island at any one time. Only two tour boats, one from Maine and one from New Brunswick, are allowed to land each day on the island’s dock. With just 15 passengers per load, spots fill up fast. By early April, both boats have usually sold out for the entire birdwatching season, which runs from June to the first week of August. Those lucky enough to score a spot must make their way to either the island of Grand Manan in New Brunswick or to Cutler, Maine, where the boats are docked. It can be tricky for the vessels to land on the narrow and rocky shores of Machias, and bad weather can easily cancel a long-awaited trip. But if the seas are fair, adventure-seekers may see a pack of seals sunning themselves on a rock during the boat ride (which is two hours from Maine and 1.5 hours from Grand Manan), or even spot a whale. Once on the island, tourists are restricted to boardwalks to keep them from stepping on a puffin burrow. The skittish birds like to avoid the human interlopers, so people crowd into wooden sheds called blinds, where they can observe the pigeon-sized, tuxedo-wearing birds undetected. The hassle is worth it, according to Dr Tony Diamond, who has been running the University of New Brunswick’s Atlantic Laboratory for Avian Research (ALAR) since 1995. “It is the only seabird colony in the whole of the East Coast where the general public can actually come on shore and get a close-up look of the birds,” he said. “It is unmatched.” In May, thousands of puffins flock to the island to dig their burrows and lay their eggs. Once the eggs have hatched, mama and papa puffin take turns guarding the chicks and going out into the sea to bring back dinner. This process, which can last until about August, attracts birdwatchers, scientists and wildlife photographers from around the world. During the summer, three researchers from ALAR live on the island full-time to track and monitor the birds’ breeding season. It is a unique experience that helps scientists like Mark Dodds get a sense of not only the individual species, but how the ocean as a whole is doing. It is like a little snapshot into the life of a bird,” Dodds said. “Through them you get a really good look at the ecosystem. But it is not the puffins of Machias Seal that have historically led the US and Canada to fight – it’s what lurks in the ocean just beyond the island. Over the past decade, the price of lobster has about tripled, with fishermen able to command about CAD$4 (£3) a pound for their catch wholesale. On a good day, a lobster boat can easily earn thousands of dollars. That makes the contested waters around Machias, nicknamed the \"grey zone\", a veritable goldmine. Neither country wants to relinquish rights to fish those waters, so the fishermen have worked out a kind of unofficial truce. “Most of the time, if you try and work with them, they will try and work with you. But if you want to be a push and shove, you are going to be pushed and shoved back,” said Donald Harris, a fisherman from Grand Manan, a Canadian island of about 2,500 people located about an hour and a half, or 32km (20 miles), away by boat from Machias. On a lazy August afternoon, Harris and a couple of other fisherman are working on their boats out by the Grand Manan pier, taking it easy before the autumn season kicks in. Practically everybody on Grand Manan is a fisherman or knows someone who is – the industry is the lifeblood of the community. The lobster boom is evident everywhere you go in Grand Manan, from houses decked out with fresh coats of paint to boats laden with the latest gear. “Lots changing. There’s a lot more people over here right now, there is a lot more stuff to do right now – our community’s getting better all the time,” said fisherman Dane Lynton. The ‘grey zone’ has only added to their wealth. Although the Canadian lobster season officially ends in June, in 2002 the government decided to allow year-round lobster fishing in the 700-sq-km (270-sq-mi) ‘grey zone’. It has helped tide many a fisherman over in the off season, and helped grow the lobster boom in Grand Manan even more. “That is just making money before we make more money,” Lynton said. But while many maintain that current regulations are enough to keep the fishery from being overfished, some are worried that the sky-high prices, driven by market demand in Asia, will prove too great a temptation. “Man can ruin anything, right? And greed will ruin a lot of things too,” Harris said. Although everyone is flush with cash for now, Harris has been around long enough to have seen the fortunes of the village go up and down with the tides, depending on what the catch is. “Usually Mother Nature looks after herself, but I have been around long enough. I have seen how the herring went, and the groundfish and the scalloping,” he said. “When you have only got lobster to rely on, and everybody is pounding so hard at the ‘grey zone’… it is all going to affect it sooner or later.” This story has been updated from its original publication to reflect recent events. During the winter, islanders must cope with extreme weekly floods. Out on Scotland's remote Shetland Islands, a famous Viking festival is firing up a strange battle for equality.

        "content": "From fiery festivals to nature's most dazzling \"sky-dance\", interest in the night skies is booming, with \"noctourism\" poised to be a major travel trend in 2025. Interest in the night skies is booming. Booking.com recently named \"noctourism\" as a top travel trend for 2025, with their survey of more than 27,000 travellers finding that around two-thirds have considered going to \"darker sky destinations\" to experience things like starbathing (lying down and looking at the night skies) and witnessing once-in-a-lifetime cosmic events. \"The cool thing about night adventures is you see so many different sides to a destination, by just staying up late or rising early,\" says Stephanie Vermillon, author of the new book 100 Nights Of A Lifetime: The World's Ultimate Adventures After Dark. \"Our senses are heightened, and there are things you see at night that you don't see any other time, so everything feels exciting and new.\" It was a 2010 trip to Morocco that sparked Vermillon's interest in all things nocturnal. \"I grew up in Dayton, Ohio, which has terrible light pollution,\" she tells the BBC. \"Then I went to the Sahara Desert and camped under the stars – I saw the Milky Way and two dozen shooting stars that night. I went home, took an astronomy class and later started hunting Northern Lights, which got me curious about what else happens around the world after dark.\" Vermillon believes that major events such as the April 2024 total solar eclipse or the 2024-2025 peak in aurora activity has led to a \"bump\" in the number of people wanting to experience dark skies. There are also now more than 200 Dark Sky Reserves across the globe. \"The great thing about the night sky is the perspective it gives you – it's humbling and grounding,\" she says. \"You can experience pure awe.\" Starry skies and aurora borealis might be the headline acts, but there's plenty more to do after dark in cities or out in nature. \"You see a city so differently at night,\" Vermillon says. \"I think of it as a city letting its hair down – it's more relaxed. I've also done night safaris, where it's more about listening than just seeing, and I've seen water sparkling with bioluminescence, which looks like magic. Everything at night has a little extra sparkle.\" Here are five of Vermillon's favourite after-dark experiences, from fiery cultural festivals to nature's greatest sky dance. Lucky travellers in the right place at the right time can witness one of the most unforgettable experiences on Earth: the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights. Created by charged particles from the Sun colliding with the Earth's atmosphere, the main activity occurs above Earth's magnetic poles, with Iceland right in the thick of the action. During the Northern Lights season (September to April), colourful displays streak across the skies for more than 100 nights, as long as cloud cover doesn't impinge. \"I've never felt goosebumps from nature more than when I'm watching the Northern Lights,\" says Vermillon. \"You're watching nature dance. It's the most magical thing.\" Strong storms can be seen with the naked eye, though many photographers also create wondrous images using long exposures on cameras. Witnessing or capturing the aurora usually means wrapping up in thick clothing and waiting for hours on a bracing hillside or glacier, far from towns or cities. But there's a warmer alternative: kicking back in Iceland's naturally heated pools. The land of fire and ice straddles the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, with geothermal energy from far below ground creating more than 700 hot springs and pools. \"You can see the Northern Lights in warmth and comfort,\" advises Vermillon. \"The water's often over 100F (38C), so you can see your breath and your hair is frosting, but the water heats you from your core. I got out of the water in a swimsuit to check my camera and I wasn't cold at all.\" Vermillon particularly recommends Ion Adventure Hotel in Selfoss for outdoor pools overlooking lava fields and snow-capped mountains, noting their Northern Lights Bar that serves a Sweet Black Death cocktail; and Heydalur, a guesthouse on a horse farm in the craggy Westfjords, where shaggy white ponies amble around the open-all-night hot pools. Located far out in the North Sea, the Shetland Islands are part of Scotland. But the islands are also geographically and culturally close to Scandinavia. The annual Up Helly Aa festival, which takes place on the last Tuesday of January in Shetland's capital, Lerwick, is a fiery, boozy spectacle that celebrates the island's Viking heritage. Vikings settled here during the 8th and 9th Centuries and lived as farmers for around 600 years before the islands came under Scottish rule in the 15th Century. After months of preparation, the midwinter celebration's main event is a torch-lit procession where around 1,000 \"guizers\" (local men) wearing Viking gear and other eye-catching costumes march through the streets, bringing with them a replica Viking longship that will later be set on fire in a grand spectacle. Afterwards, locals fill community halls and pubs for dancing, music and drinking into the early hours of the morning. \"So many cultural festivals are ancient, but this one started around 200 years ago, so it's relatively new,\" says Vermillon. \"They created it as an ode to their Viking heritage. It's cool to see that pride in where people come from. Up Helly Aa's also special for the visuals: night, darkness and fire.\" Smaller Up Helly Aa events also also take place across the islands from January to March. Shetland's northerly location – closer to the Arctic Circle than London – means there's a decent chance of seeing the aurora in the winter months, known locally as the \"mirrie dancers\", from mirr, whichmeans \"to shimmer\". The remote Atacama region in northern Chile is the driest nonpolar desert on Earth. With high elevations and an average of 300 clear, cloud-free nights a year, it's a renowned location for professional astronomers. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), one of the most powerful telescope systems anywhere on Earth, was constructed here to study the universe's great mysteries. \"Atacama has the clearest night skies I've ever seen, and clear skies for as many nights in a row as I've ever had,\" says Vermillon. All this means that \"there's a community of entrepreneurs who have created incredible experiences around stargazing\", says Vermillon, including astrophotography tours and archaeoastronomy sessions featuring Indigenous stories about the cosmos, as well as private observatories where experts teach tourists about Southern Hemisphere constellations and more. Visiting just before, during or after a new Moon is recommended for the darkest skies and most dramatic starscapes. \"You see a blanket of stars, more stars than you've ever seen in your lifetime, with skies that are darker and more pinpricked than I've ever seen,\" says Vermillon. \"But the landscape around you also makes you feel like you're out there among the stars – you look around and you feel like you're on Mars or on the Moon. NASA uses parts of Atacama to test for their missions for life on Mars because Atacama has such 'martian' landscapes. Atacama really is next-level.\" \"Reading the morning newspaper\" is how wildlife guides across Africa refer to seeing animal tracks and other signs of activity that show what happened during the night, including scuffles or hunts. But taking a night safari means wildlife-lovers can watch, or listen to, the \"news\" for themselves. More like this: • Eight of the world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms • Five of the world's most beautiful climbing locations • Australia’s answer to the Northern Lights Night-time is when many creatures are most active, especially predators such as lions and leopards, who often rest during the heat of the day, and Vermillon recommends heading to Zambia to experience it. \"Zambia has so many opportunities for night safaris,\" she says, picking out South Luangwa National Park, Lower Zambezi National Park and Kafue National Park (Zambia's oldest and largest national park) for chances to see big cats, elephants and other remarkable creatures. \"You often see leopards lazing in trees by day, but to actually see a leopard stalking around at night, when there are so few people or vehicles, is so different,\" Vermillon says. \"I like watching hyenas at night because you really see their 'creepy' character. I remember watching hyena circling a lion, trying to steal its prey – incredible.\" Plenty of other animals are on the move after dark. \"I love bush babies,\" says Vermillon. \"They have such dramatic features – big ears and oversized, cartoon-like eyes – and they're a pretty common night-safari find because they're most active at night to avoid predators. I also love night drives for owls. With day safaris, so much is about seeing, but at night the pressure is off and it's more about listening, too, which is a less appreciated part of the safari experience. I love that period around 02:00 where you wake up in camp to hyena laughs or lion roars. You're, like, \"Woah, where am I?\". When you're out on night safaris, it's like you're out there among that. You're watching and listening as the animal kingdom does its thing.\" The smells of Taiwan's food markets might hit you before the sights and sounds as dozens of stalls cook up delicacies, sending smoke and steam from grills, pots and pans drifting into the night air. There are more than 100 night markets across the country, with cooks selling xiaochi, the Chinese word for \"snacks\", to locals and visitors. Many of the markets are open from late afternoon into the early hours of the morning or even sunrise, but they're particularly busy when local temples finish their services. \"The majority of Taiwan's temples are Taoist and Buddhist,\" explains Vermillon. \"The night markets usually have a historic temple in the market or right next to it and the vendors popped up around these gathering areas to sell goods and snacks. Over time, they grew into what they are today. People head there after the service to hang out and eat together. In the US, markets can feel touristy, weird or artificial, but I feel like these markets were built to serve a purpose: the community. The markets are built there authentically for people to gather after the temples but it's a cool experience for tourists, too.\" There are more than 30 night markets in the capital, Taipei, including Shilin Night Market, the largest and most popular; and Raohe Night Market, among Taipei's oldest, dating to 1987. \"Almost every market has a different dish they're known for,\" says Vermillon. \"The oyster omelette is a staple at Shilin Night Market. Raohe Night Market is known for its Fuzhou black pepper bun: a crispy pork bun topped with a black pepper sauce and onions.\" Brave travellers might also want to keep an eye, or nose, out for the fried \"stinky tofu\", a pungently aromatic fermented bean curd dish that is \"very common in the after-hours markets\". The buzzing markets, which also selling clothing, art, crafts and other souvenirs, can get crowded. Be prepared to queue at the best stalls for speciality dishes. 100 Nights of a Lifetime: The World's Ultimate Adventures After Dark by Stephanie Vermillon is published by National Geographic. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "From Colombia's upcycled sewer pipes to spheres suspended in the sky in Canada, capsule hotels have been reinvented for a new generation of travellers. By night, the world's first capsule hotel (founded in Osaka, Japan in 1979) must have looked like a morgue, with neat rows of narrow sleeping capsules each containing a recumbent body. But the following day, the occupants – mostly businessmen who had worked late - would rise up and head back to the office, grateful for this efficient sleep solution that had saved them a commute home in the early hours. As the concept spread, tourists happy to sleep in a room no bigger than its bed began to bunk up alongside them, eager to sample this unusual aspect of Japanese culture. Fast-forward to today, and high hotel room rates, fuelled by years of rising real estate prices, have supercharged this typically low-cost concept, which offers budget travellers priced out of traditional hotels more privacy than a hostel dormitory and more comfort and connectivity than camping. The capsules, which are predominantly single-occupancy, also answer the current boom in solo travel, with single-sex capsule hotels providing additional security. With the global capsule hotel market projected to reach $327m by 2031, curious hybrids have emerged to sustain the trend and attract new customers. They're tempting the TikTok generation with increasingly outlandish forms, from upcycled sewer pipes in the Colombian desert to space-age pods with a dashboard of ambient controls in downtown Sydney, Australia – all promising a unique experience and shareable stories for social media. Meanwhile capsule-cum-bookstores invite book lovers to snooze among the shelves, and boutique versions bring luxury to a traditionally no-frills market with fancy decor or promises of fluffy duck-feather duvets. As the concept continues to reinvent itself, here are eight of the most extraordinary examples. Nine Hours, a chain of 13 hotels across Japan, from Fukuoka in the west to the north-east island of Hokkaido, has an unusual by-product: sleep data. In the Shinagawa Station (men only) and Akasaka branches, guests can sign up for a \"9h sleep fitscan\" service, where sensors detect everything from breathing to facial expressions to generate a sleep report that tracks their heart rate, identifies sleep apnea and even monitors snoring. In a sector where a novel or low-budget stay is often prioritised over comfort, Nine Hours' interest in how well its guests are sleeping sets it apart. Across the franchise, the white, minimalist decor continues this clinical theme, while its rows of sleek, shiny sleeping pods would not look out of place on the set of a science-fiction movie. The name refers to the hotel's cost-cutting concept that reduces room rental to the essential nine hours, allowing seven hours for sleep and an hour on either side for washing and dressing. Just need a nap? Hourly rates are also available. A night in a transparent sleeping pod clinging to a cliff face above Peru's Sacred Valley is not everyone's idea of a relaxing stay, but for adrenaline-lovers, it's hard to beat – not least for the incredible 300-degree views of the surrounding mountains and the formidable condors that inhabit them. A near-vertical climb of 400m is the only way to reach the Skylodge Adventure Suites, but climbing experience is not necessary – only good health and a head for heights – and descending is speedier thanks to a series of zip wires. Each capsule includes a private bathroom ensuring that night trips to the toilet are not life-threatening, and when the sun rises, you can enjoy a cup of tea on your private deck. Looking for a little more luxury? A little further down the Urubamba river, sister site, Starlodge, adds hillside hot tubs to the capsule hotel experience. The Tubo Hotel, La Tatacoa is just a 10-minute drive from Colombia's second-largest desert, the eponymous Tatacoa, famous for its clear starry skies. When you've taken in the giant cacti and curious rock formations of the Tatacoa's cinnamon-coloured sands, this rainbow of tiny, air-conditioned rooms with a shared swimming pool offers a welcome oasis. The 37 capsules are fashioned from concrete sewer pipes painted in candy colours, providing just enough room for a double bed. Almost half of the rooms have a shared bathroom, but the room rate is a snip and you've a shady garden, bar and restaurant on your doorstep. \"This innovative and colourful place offers you a unique experience,\" says Ambar Quintana, the hotel's administrator. \"It has everything you need to rest in a natural environment of fresh air and vegetation.\" Suspended among the conifers like oversized Christmas baubles, the Free Spirit Spheres on Vancouver Island, Canada, feel \"like you are floating in the canopy among the sleeping birds\", according to owner Tom Chudleigh. The first sphere was introduced 25 years ago, driven by a desire to promote ecotourism and preserve Canada's ancient forests. More like this: • The UK's five most beautiful national parks • The best travel photographs from around the globe • The Japanese philosophy for a no-waste world There are currently three spheres, each based on the principle of biomimicry and shaped with a giant seed pod or nutshell in mind: light but with a strong shell. \"Eryn\" is fashioned from Sitka spruce and has a dining area, sink and slightly undersized double bed inside; while more recent additions, \"Melody\" and \"Luna\", are fibreglass and have similar amenities but with full-size double beds that can be stowed. Each sphere is accessed via a spiral staircase wrapped around a tree, and is available to rent in temperatures as low as -20C, when even a trip to the composting toilet at the accommodation's base will feel intrepid. The shape makes bespoke fittings a prerequisite, and every little detail has been meticulously crafted by Chudleigh, from walnut fold-out furniture that maximises the space, to door handles cast from bronze. Inside a Brutalist building in Singapore's Chinatown lies a surprisingly serene interior. Opened in 2021 and based on an aesthetic it describes as \"soft minimalist\", KINN Capsule offers a Zen take on the capsule concept with walls painted in calming peachy tones and pale wood sleeping chambers fitted with crisp white bed linen. Even the smell of the place seems an antidote to its urban location as a special house fragrance designed to evoke the wildflowers of a Nordic forest hangs in the air. There are 72 capsules in total, sealed off with blackout blinds and spread across seven rooms, but the vibe is more boutique than bunkhouse. A traditional mud and wood farmhouse in eastern China's Zhejiang Province got a prize-winning makeover in 2019 when it reopened as a capsule hostel, bookstore and community library, sleeping 20 in tiny single bed-sized compartments concealed between bookshelves made of local bamboo. A smattering of small landings are connected by zigzagging stairways that recall the serpentine paths of the surrounding forests of Tonglu. It's hard to know which is more dramatic: the remote building's transparent floor-to-ceiling panels that light it up like a cathedral at night, or the lush mountainous scenery that's visible through them. In Oud Zuid, one of Amsterdam's most upscale neighbourhoods, guests are paying to sleep in cupboards. The quirky De Bedstee Hotel draws on the 17th-Century tradition of the Dutch bedstee (box bed), a bed concealed behind cupboard doors to create a cosy sleeping nook. The hotel's Art Deco features and acid-coloured wallpapers downstairs give way to a shabby-chic design in the first-floor dormitories, where the bedstee windows are framed by red gingham curtains and little wooden ladders lead to the capsules above. Relax in the hotel's small terrace garden or take a half-hour stroll to the Rembrandt House Museum in the city centre to see several historic box beds in situ. Another hotel with a signature smell is the Resol Poshtel in Tokyo's Asakusa district – the Resol Hotel chain's first venture into capsule sleeping. The aroma, which includes orange, chamomile and neroli, is said to induce \"a feeling of gentle calm\" – of benefit, perhaps, given the communal sleeping arrangements. At bedtime, there's nothing but a curtain between you and fellow visitors, but few one-star establishments can match this hotel's cleanliness and functionality, with hairbrushes, slippers and razors included in the freebies. The Edo-era styling − such as the sleeping cubicles' arched entrance reminiscent of tea ceremony rooms, and the traditional Japanese murals surrounding the bed − add a hint of heritage to the hotel's modern lines. The city's oldest Buddhist temple, Sensō-ji, is a five-minute walk away, as is the lantern-lined Nakamise-dori street, home to a parade of colourful shops selling souvenirs and street food. -- This story was first published in August and was one of our most-read Travel stories of the year.

        "content": "Mayara Lima is famous for her hypnotising samba style. Here, she shares the best samba experiences in Rio, from traditional school events to samba circles. Brazilians often say that \"everything ends in samba\", but perhaps it would be more accurate to say that samba never ends – at least not in Rio de Janeiro, one of the places where the musical and dance genre is said to have originated. Aside from providing entertainment, samba has played a crucial role in shaping Rio's lifestyle, including taking a central role in its Carnival celebration – the most renowned in the world. More than just a genre, samba is a cultural phenomenon that helps drive the economy, with more than 150 official rodas de samba (samba circles) across the city. At these lively gatherings, musicians sit in a circle while crowds of hundreds – or even thousands – of spectators sing along, creating an electrifying atmosphere. Meanwhile, escolas de samba (community-based \"samba schools\" that organise the world-famous Carnival parade with its giant floats and thrilling costumes) elect a rainha da bateria (queen of the drums) who leads the school's bateria (drum section), captivating the crowd and forging a powerful connection between the musicians and the audience. The SpeciaList Mayara Lima is one of Rio's most popular samba queens, having claimed the title of drum queen in 2023. She currently represents the Paraíso do Tuiuti samba school, where she gained national recognition for her mesmerising samba style. But the energy of samba can be felt in Rio all year round. Even outside Carnival season, events like samba school street rehearsals offer a vibrant and immersive experience. We asked Mayara Lima, a rainha de bateria (drum queen) at Pararaíso do Tuiti, one of Rio's most renowned samba schools, how to experience the city's rich samba culture during Carnival and beyond. Lima knew from an early age that dance was her calling, and she joined a samba school at age 10. \"I had studied other rhythms, such as ballet and jazz, but I decided to be fully dedicated to samba,\" she says. Lima is a proud carioca – a Rio native. \"To me, Rio is far more than just a city,\" she says. \"What makes Rio so unique is the way it combines breathtaking natural beauty – its beaches and trails – with the energy of a vibrant, urban metropolis, where every neighbourhood has its own distinct charm and history.\" She adds: \"[But] you can't talk about Rio without talking about samba, can you? Their histories are intertwined.\" Ahead of the 2025 Carnival, which runs from 28 February to 8 March, here are five of Lima's favorite samba experiences in Rio. Rio's samba school parade is a global spectacle every Carnival season. Of the more than 70 samba schools, only a select few belong to the elite group that takes centre stage, parading down the Sambódromo Marquês de Sapucaí during the festivities – but the schools promote several events during the year that take place in the quadras (samba school headquarters), which play a key role in strengthening ties between the schools and the local community. Tip: Rio's music scene is about more than just samba. \"Baile Charme, an old-school R&B event, under the Madureira viaduct every Saturday [starts] at 20:00 and ends at the sunrise at 05:00,\" says Lima. This event has been going strong for over 20 years and remains a huge success, attracting thousands of people every week. \"It's a great way to see another side of Rio's music scene.\" Cariocas and visitors of all ages come to samba schools to watch rehearsals, participate in feijoadas (a traditional feast of black beans and pork) and enjoy live performances of the school's samba anthem; a new one is chosen each year to serve as the narrative musical thread for each performance. \"There are 12 main samba schools [in Rio], which means 12 opportunities to experience samba,\" says Lima. \"While there's no fixed schedule for events, something is always happening. Each school hosts feijoadas several times a year. They feature guest performers playing not just samba, but also pagode [a type of samba/subgenre of samba] and carioca funk.\" For Lima, the Grêmio Recreativo Escola de Samba Acadêmicos do Salgueiro samba school holds one of Rio's best feijoadas. \"It's a thrilling event, it often happens in the first Monday of each month,\" she says. But her favourite type of samba school event is undoubtedly street rehearsals. \"As Carnival approaches, we hold street rehearsals every Monday in front of the samba school before heading inside to continue practicing,\" she says. \"It's amazing!\" Each school announces its events on social media. Street rehearsals are free, but other events, such as feijoada feast and samba circles, usually require a ticket. Website: www.salgueiro.com.br Address: R. Silva Teles, 104 - Andaraí Phone: +552238-9226 Instagram: @salgueirooriginal  Pedra do Sal – a sloping set of stone steps found in Morro da Conceição, known as Rio's \"Little Africa\" – is believed to have been the birthplace of samba in the early 20th Century. When the area served as a market for enslaved people and the unloading point for salt (sal in Portuguese) shipments, it also became a gathering place for enslaved Africans, who came together to honour their deities and play the instruments that became part of samba's DNA, like the pandeiro (tambourine). During the day, Pedra do Sal's rich history attracts small groups of tourists eager to understand Rio's past. But as the sun sets, the streets fill with vendors and hundreds of visitors drawn to the city's most famous roda de samba. Once held only on Monday nights, the event grew so popular that organisers expanded it to four nights a week, from Friday to Monday – though Monday remains the busiest night. The music spills over Pedra do Sal's famous steps, creating an electrifying, open-air celebration. \"Pedra do Sal attracts such a diverse crowd – you'll find people from all over the city, from different backgrounds, and loads of tourists too,\" says Lima. \"It's a great mix, and that reflects in the music. Samba is the essence, but you'll hear other rhythms too.\" Address: Rua Argemiro Bulcão, s/n, Saúde, Instagram: @pedradosaloficial In the city's northern zone, 21km from the historic Copacabana beach, hundreds of samba enthusiasts gather at the Pagode do Chinelo roda in the Pilares borough, right next to the renowned samba school Caprichosos de Pilares. Like most rodas de samba, the gathering started with modest expectations – just a group of friends meeting every Monday for a cold beer and some samba – but the samba do Chinelo quickly became a sensation and is now one of Rio’s official rodas de samba, attracting locals and celebrities alike, and has since evolved into a professionally structured event. \"This is one of those places everyone goes to. It's a given that it'll be packed every Monday, with plenty of famous faces in the crowd. Sometimes you even see singers like [Grammy winner] Ludmilla performing – it's really cool,\" says Lima. The event kicks off at 18:00 and carries on into the late night. Pagode do Chinelo is also the perfect spot to experience different samba styles. \"It's a great place to enjoy a more melodic samba, which is slower, or samba partido-alto, which is faster and more upbeat. It's brilliant fun,\" says Lima. Address: Rua Faleiros, 1, Pilares Instagram: @resenhapagodeechinelo 4. Best for experiencing classic samba: Cacique de Ramos The northern zone of the city is also home to one of Rio's most traditional rodas de samba. Tip: For those looking for a more laid-back way to explore Rio, Lima recommends having breakfast inside the Jardim Botânico. \"Some of the cafes in the garden allow you to enjoy a morning meal surrounded by nature overlooking century-old trees,\" she says \"It’s the perfect place to start your day in a relaxing atmosphere before exploring the city's other attractions.\" Founded in the 1960s, Cacique de Ramos became famous for its legendary samba gatherings, where some of the genre's most celebrated artists first rose to prominence. Often described as the \"headquarters of samba\", it has played a pivotal role in shaping Rio's Carnival culture. \"This is where you'll find classic samba,\" says Lima. \"Cacique de Ramos is the birthplace of many greats, including Arlindo Cruz, Zeca Pagodinho and Beth Carvalho. If you want to experience that unique energy, this is the place to go.\" The samba takes place every Sunday in Cacique de Ramos samba hall, making it an ideal option for those looking to enjoy a lively evening without a late finish. \"Since it's on a Sunday, Cacique de Ramos wraps up around midnight,\" says Lima. \"So if you need to be up early the next day but still want to make the most of your weekend, it's perfect. It's definitely one of my favourites.\" Website: www.caciquederamos.com.br Address: Rua Uranos, 1326 - Olaria Phone: +55213251-4374 Instagram: @cacique_de_ramos Baródromo is a well-known samba venue among cariocas and a favourite gathering spot for samba enthusiasts. The walls are adorned with Carnival costumes and masks, immersing guests in the samba atmosphere the moment they step inside. \"It's always buzzing, absolutely packed,\" says Lima. \"It's a bar with a proper traditional samba roda, where people clap along to the beat – it's such a great vibe. The whole place is dedicated to samba, and that's what makes it so special.\" The venue is open from Tuesday to Sunday, with samba sessions every night, ranging from performances of traditional samba to live sets from samba school baterias. Baródromo is a popular venue that frequently fills to capacity, occasionally leading to slower service. However, the lively atmosphere and infectious energy of the crowd create a fully immersive experience, with the music at its heart.

        "content": "Wesley Schultz, half of the rock duo The Lumineers, knows all the best places to go in Denver. Here are his local favourites, from concerts at Red Rocks to wine at Sunday Vinyl. Denver, Colorado is known for its laid-back lifestyle, its easy access to hiking and biking and a myriad of cultural and culinary attractions. Wesley Schultz sings lead vocals and plays guitar for folk-rock band The Lumineers. The group (which also includes drummer Jeremiah Fraites) has been nominated for numerous Grammy Awards, and for the American Music and Billboard Music Awards. Their discography includes 24 number-one hits including Cleopatra, Brightside, Hey-Ho, Ophelia and Angela. Their fifth album, Automatic, debuts on 21 February 2025 and will be followed by an international tour. With the Rocky Mountains as its backdrop, the Mile High City's glittering skyscrapers and artsy vibe belie its Wild West roots. Wesley Schultz, who along with Jeremiah Fraites is part of the internationally renowned folk-rock band The Lumineers, has called Denver home since 2009. Though the band formed in 2005, it was their move from New Jersey to Denver that rocketed them to stardom. Schultz credits the relocation with giving them the space as creators to define their signature energetic folk-rock style and to write the songs that have brought them their fame. \"We just kind of took a chance, and when we got here, it was beautiful,\" says Schultz. \"There are a lot of transplants here; the weather is gorgeous and the people are super-friendly. I love it here.\" Denver is also a short drive from one of the world's most unique and remarkable music venues – Red Rocks Park & Amphitheatre; a venue built into and surrounded by orange-red sandstone rock formations that create a natural theatre. A bucket-list destination for performers and concert-goers alike, the stage has welcomed musical acts like The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, U2, Bob Dylan and Widespread Panic. \"You get a relatively intimate concert with some of the best acts in the world, who are bringing their A-game when they play there,\" says Schultz. \"The artist is in awe of what they're seeing just as much as the audience is. You're in awe of the natural beauty and it's the best venue of any I've ever played as far as sound and lighting… It's amazing that it's right in our backyard.\" Whether you're in town for a show at Red Rocks or otherwise, here's how Schultz recommends spending a weekend in Denver. One of Schultz's favourite things to do with his family is bring them to the Children's Museum of Denver; a venue that encourages dynamic play. \"You're kind of surprised that you don't have to sign more waivers – in a good way,\" he says. Intrepid youngsters can don helmets and climb to the top of a towering structure; use recycled materials to make their own creations from tools like saws, hammers and screwdrivers; play pretend at a \"supermarket\" or immerse themselves in a myriad of activities involving bubbles. The museum also hosts numerous special events for children and their accompanying adults. Grown-ups can relax while watching their kids roam free in the museum's outdoor park, which features climbing, digging and water exhibits, plus a zipline. For families like Schultz's who have young ones, the Children's Museum is a place where kids get to be themselves, explore and have fun. \"It's great for new families,\" he says. \"We love to bring our kids to the Children's Museum.\" Website: https://www.mychildsmuseum.org Address: 2121 Children’s Museum Drive, Denver, CO 80211 Phone: 303-433-7444 Instagram: @childrensmuseumdenver Denver's culinary scene ranges from upscale Michelin-starred restaurants to places like Old West-style saloons. One of the most legendary eateries is El Taco de Mexico, an unassuming yellow stucco restaurant on 7th Avenue and Santa Fe Drive. \"It's a place Stealth [Ulvang, who plays keyboards for The Lumineers] took me to because he was a local and showed me the local wisdom,\" says Schultz. \"All the musicians know about this spot. Once I was there and met the guitarist from Cheap Trick – he was in town to play Red Rocks that night.\" Opened in 1985 by Mexico City native MaLuisa Zanabria with the help of her mother, the restaurant brought hungry Denverites a taste of Mexico City's street food. At this counter service-only eatery, patrons order off an illuminated letter board menu featuring authentic tacos, burritos, enchiladas, sopes, chiles rellenos and tamales, often smothered in its legendary green chilli. The modest restaurant has a cult following and was the recipient of a James Beard American Classics Award in 2020. \"They used to be cash-only and only women work there,\" says Schultz. \"They cook using real lard, they have beef tongue and kind of exotic stuff on the menu. I always order the chile relleno burrito smothered [with green chilli] and it's life-changing.\" Website: http://www.eltacodemexico5280.com Address: 714 Santa Fe Drive, Denver, CO 80204 Phone: 303-623-3926 Instagram: @eltacodemexicodenver To enjoy the great outdoors without having to drive for hours, Schultz recommends Golden Gate Canyon State Park; less than an hour's drive from downtown Denver. Insider Tip: Sit in the Rockpile The Rockpile is a special section at Coors Field, home to the Colorado Rockies baseball team, where tickets cost just $4.00 (£3.2); available to buy in person two hours before the game. \"It's a very quintessential Denver thing to do, to buy tickets to sit in the Rockpile. It's a really special place to take it in,\" says Schultz. \"I'm a sports fan and Denver is a small town that has some of the best players in the world.\" The park offers 56 kms of hiking, biking and equestrian trails, with a variety of ecosystems including mountain meadows full of flowers, lush alpine streams and lakes, rocky peaks and areas densely populated with evergreen trees. It's also home to wildlife like moose, deer and bobcats and offers stunning panoramic views of the Continental Divide. \"I've been hiking at Golden Gate Canyon State Park – it's a really pretty hike and you feel like you're in the middle of nowhere, but it's not far from Denver at all,\" says Schultz. For those who want to make their outdoor adventure into an overnight excursion, the park has campgrounds with full hookups, backcountry campsites, cabins and yurts. Website: https://cpw.state.co.us/state-parks/golden-gate-canyon-state-park Address: 92 Crawford Gulch Road, Golden, CO 80403 Phone: 303-582-3707 Instagram: @goldengatecanyoncpw For a live musical experience that's slightly more low-key than Red Rocks, Schultz recommends the classic Denver watering hole, PS Lounge. \"The PS Lounge is really fun. The owner used to serve Tang shots to all the ladies,\" says Schultz. \"There's a free pool table, which was great when we were poor musicians. It's a friendly, interesting, quirky place. I love it. It's right by the Bluebird [Theater] and by Lost Lake Lounge.\" Walking through the doors at PS Lounge is like going through a portal to a mid-1980s dive bar. Its octogenarian owner, Pete Siahamis, has helmed the bar for decades, serving every woman who comes in a single rose and a sugary Alabama Slammer shot. The lounge still has a jukebox, is still cash only and its walls are plastered with snapshots of its guests over the years mingled with Greek tchotchkes like a statue of the Venus de Milo tucked between bottles behind the bar, in homage to Siahamis’ Greek roots.

Colfax Avenue, Denver, CO 80206 Phone: 303-320-1200 Instagram: @ps.lounge.denver RiNo, or Denver's River North neighbourhood, is an arts district known for its colourful murals, hip cocktail lounges, retail shops, galleries and upscale restaurants. Once an industrial area occupied primarily by warehouses, factories and railyards, the area began transforming a decade ago. Some of the existing buildings have remained and have new tenants, but in other cases, empty lots have been developed with new builds. \"The RiNo area is a place where you can walk along Larimer Street all the way to the baseball stadium,\" says Schultz. \"Once you're there, that whole area, there's stuff all around. When I first moved to Denver, there was nothing there – it was a lonesome stretch. Now it's one of the most desirable places. I really love to take friends there and just walking along there.\" RiNo offers easy access to the downtown and lively LoDo neighbourhoods by foot or on a bike. The city has both scooter and bike share scheme. \"The city is super walkable,\" says Schultz. \"They're making Denver more and more bike friendly, too. If you can take advantage of that, it’s beautiful.” Website: https://rinoartdistrict.org/ Address: 1320 27th Street, Ste. G, Denver Instagram: @rinoartdistrict \"A very special place for drinks [like] cocktails but especially for wine, is Sunday Vinyl,\" says Schultz. Found just behind Union Station, the Mediterranean tapas bar Sunday Vinyl is helmed by local restaurateur and music lover Bobby Stuckey; inspired by the success of his weekly Instagram posts where he chronicled himself pairing a record with a bottle of wine. They do these theme nights, where they pick a record and pair that with a drink,\" says Schultz. \"It's a whole vibe. They spent something like a half million dollars on the sound system and they just spin vinyl, that's all they do. Even for my friends that are really into music, it's cool to remember just how special it is to be around music and seeing the cover of an album, and holding a record, it's just really tangible.\" Website: https://www.sundayvinyl.com/ Address: 1803 16th Street, Denver, CO 80202 Phone: 303-738-1803 Instagram: @sundayvinyldenver BBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.
