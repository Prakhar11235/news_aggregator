        "headline": "Will Starmer's defence hike win over Trump?",
        "author": "James Landale",
        "published_date": "14 hours ago",
        "summary": "The prime minister has set out plans to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
        "content": "Sir Keir Starmer's promise to increase defence spending will have several consequences.  It may one day actually strengthen the UK's ability to defend itself. More immediately it will mean billions less spent on foreign aid. But what will it buy the prime minister diplomatically in Washington? In times past visiting dignitaries would give emperors gifts and tributes. Starmer  will now turn up at the White House on Thursday with a large goodie bag marked \"more defence spending\". Donald Trump is just the latest in a long line of US presidents urging European powers to spend more on their own defence. The prime minister will be able to say to the president that he has heard the call and acted. He might not want Trump to ask too many detailed questions: What does an added 0.2% of GDP mean in real money? When will the UK actually spend 3% on defence? But Starmer will want to land the idea that the UK is responding to Trump's agenda. Early signs are positive. Peter Hegseth, the US Secretary of Defence, said he had spoken to his UK counterpart, John Healey, and described the increase as \"a strong step from an enduring partner\". So Starmer's announcement may well get his foot in the door at the White House and a hearing from the president. But will it help him make the case for the security of Ukraine and Europe? Will Trump now be more amenable to allowing both a seat at the negotiating table? Will Trump be more open to the idea that the United States should play a role guaranteeing post-war Ukraine's security, giving air, logistics and intelligence cover to European forces helping to keep the peace on the ground? The answer to those questions is not clear cut. The prime minister may suggest the UK is showing leadership, pointing the way for other European allies to follow suit. He may also argue that the defence hike shows the UK will not have to make what he calls the \"historic mistake\" of having to choose between Europe and the US, something made much harder by the US decision to vote with Russia against Ukraine and Europe at the United Nations on Monday. The problem is that Trump and his administration have made it clear that their security priority is China and Europe will just have to do more to look after itself. Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute, told the BBC: \"The reality is that whatever we do on defence, the US is going to pivot elsewhere, it is not going to take the lead role in European security that it has done for more than half a century.\" In that context, the government's promised increase in defence spending may be seen as a short-term tactical move ahead of Starmer's visit to Washington, rather than an historic response to the existential geopolitical changes posed by Trump's election. European diplomats told me they were underwhelmed by the UK defence offer, saying it was not enough to have a real impact. They said the UK would have to spend at least 3% of national wealth soon to give itself a chance to develop the capability it would need. To do that, the government would have to do more than raid the development budget. Aid charities noted that their spending was a soft target compared to those of massive spending departments such as welfare, health and education. But few politicians of any political colour appear prepared to start making an argument for a transformation of the post-war European welfare model and prepare voters for a massive change in defence spending. For now, the government is cutting foreign aid and international charities are furious. The reduction from 0.5% of national income to 0.3% means £6bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year. Given that billions of this budget still pays for asylum seekers' hotels here in the UK, the actual amount spent on aid overseas will be about 0.15%. The prime minister said the UK would use this remaining aid money to help Sudan, Ukraine and Gaza, tackle climate change, and support multinational efforts on global health. Aid charities were stunned. Save the Children said it was betrayal of the world's most vulnerable children. The One campaign said it would create huge problems for the delivery of vital humanitarian assistance. The aid network BOND said there would be devastating consequences for millions of marginalised people. All this after Donald Trump froze America's development spending arm, USAID. By cutting foreign aid, the government has broken a manifesto commitment to protect the budget. It has also damaged its policy of using aid to engage more closely with countries in the global south. David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee and former Labour foreign secretary, said the cut was \"a blow to Britain's proud reputation as a global humanitarian and development leader\".

        "headline": "BP shuns renewables in return to oil and gas",
        "author": "Simon Jack and Faarea Masud",
        "published_date": "25 minutes ago",
        "summary": "The energy giant has announced its strategy after rivals also rowed back on green energy plans.",
        "content": "BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production. The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been much lower than its rivals. BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (£7.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned renewables funding by more than $5bn (£3.9bn). The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels. Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the move was a \"fundamental reset\" of the firm's strategy and that its focus would be on boosting returns for shareholders. He added the company would be \"very selective\" of investment in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, reducing funding to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year. BP's share price was climbing before the announcement but fell by 2% shortly after. Some shareholders and environmental groups have previously voiced concerns over any potential ramping up on production of fossil fuels. Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables. In 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%. Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near £4bn stake in the £70bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas. In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (£7.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year. Since 2020 when former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36% over the last five years. In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively. BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations. Not all shareholders want the company to change course so radically. Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from its previous commitments to renewables. A spokesperson for one of the signatories, Royal London Asset Management, said: \"As long-term shareholders, we recognise BP's past efforts toward energy transition but remain concerned about the company's continued investment in fossil fuel expansion.\" The environmental group Greenpeace UK has warned BP could expect \"pushback and challenge at every turn if it doubles down on fossil fuels - not just from green campaigners but from its own shareholders\". Senior climate adviser Charlie Kronick said: \"Government policies will also need to prioritise renewable power, and as extreme weather puts pressure on insurance models - policymakers will be looking to fossil fuel profits as a way to fund extreme weather recovery. BP might want to seriously put the brakes on this U-turn.\" \"I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,\" added Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank. He told the BBC's Today programme that the \"overall energy transition\" to renewables was \"still going to come\". \"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said. BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business. The refocus on oil and gas could also see sales of other businesses in order to get \"non-core stuff off the books\" as insiders describe it. It is over 20 years since former chief executive Lord John Browne said BP could stand for \"Beyond Petroleum\" as he launched the company's first tentative moves away from oil and gas. Today's strategy shift could be dubbed \"Back to Petroleum\" - to the delight of some shareholders and to the dismay of others.

        "headline": "Gaza ceasefire deal impasse resolved by mediators, officials say",
        "author": "David Gritten",
        "published_date": "3 hours ago",
        "summary": "The delayed release of 600 Palestinian prisoners will reportedly go ahead when Hamas returns four Israeli hostages' bodies.",
        "content": "Israeli and Hamas officials say the latest impasse in the Gaza ceasefire deal has been resolved by mediators. Israel had delayed the release of 600 Palestinian prisoners on Saturday in protest at what it said was the cruel treatment of Israeli hostages being handed over by Hamas. Hamas said this was a serious violation of the deal. It is now expected that the prisoners will be freed as well as another batch, possibly later on Wednesday or Thursday, in exchange for the return of the bodies of four hostages. That would clear the way for US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to visit the region. He has said he wants Israel and Hamas to begin delayed talks on the second stage of the ceasefire. News of the breakthrough came as thousands of Israelis gathered in the central city of Rishon LeZion to watch the funeral procession of hostages Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, whose bodies were returned by Hamas last week. They were killed in captivity after being kidnapped during Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which triggered the war in Gaza. Hamas said in a statement on Tuesday night that a delegation led by the group's Gaza leader, Khalil al-Hayya, had concluded a trip to Cairo after reaching an agreement to resolve the problem over the delayed release of the Palestinian prisoners. \"They will be released simultaneously with the bodies of the Israeli [hostages] agreed to be handed over during the first phase, in addition to the corresponding Palestinian women and children,\" it added. Hayya also reiterated Hamas's commitment to the ceasefire deal \"with all its stages and clauses\". There was no immediate confirmation from the Israeli government. But Israeli sources told the Haaretz newspaper that the bodies of the four hostages were likely to be handed over by Hamas on Wednesday evening at the Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Gaza. The source added that the families of the four hostages had been notified. They were not identified, but are believed to be Shlomo Mansour, 86, Ohad Yahalomi, 50, Tsachi Idan, 50, and Itzik Elgarat, 69. Egyptian officials said Hamas had agreed to hand over the bodies on Thursday without any ceremonies inside Gaza. Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - had warned earlier this week that it would not take part in indirect talks about further steps in the ceasefire unless the prisoners were released. The 620 Palestinian prisoners - including more than 400 Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war and 50 prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails - were supposed to have been released in return for six living and four dead hostages handed over by Hamas last week. A total of 33 Israeli hostages are supposed to be exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza during the ceasefire deal's first phase, which is due to end on Saturday. So far, 25 living hostages and four dead hostages have been released. Both Israel and Hamas have said the last four hostages are dead. Five living Thai hostages have also been freed outside the deal. The agreement has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been allowed to return to their homes in the north and hundreds of aid lorries are now being allowed into the territory each day. The ceasefire's second phase should see the 57 remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the 7 October attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. At least 48,348 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population of 2.1 million has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.

        "headline": "Billion Indians have no spending money - report",
        "author": "Nikhil Inamdar, BBC News, Mumbai",
        "published_date": "13 hours ago",
        "summary": "India's population is 1.4 billion but its consuming class is only 140 million, or about as big as Mexico.",
        "content": "India is home to 1.4 billion people but around a billion lack money to spend on any discretionary goods or services, a new report estimates. The country's consuming class, effectively the potential market for start-ups or business owners, is only about as big as Mexico, 130-140 million people, according to the report from Blume Ventures, a venture capital firm. Another 300 million are \"emerging\" or \"aspirant\" consumers but they are reluctant spenders who have only just begun to open their purse strings, as click-of-a-button digital payments make it easy to transact. What is more, the consuming class in Asia's third largest economy is not \"widening\" as much as it is \"deepening\", according to the report. That basically means India's wealthy population is not really growing in numbers, even though those who are already rich are getting even wealthier. All of this is shaping the country's consumer market in distinct ways, particularly accelerating the trend of \"premiumisation\" where brands drive growth by doubling down on expensive, upgraded products catering to the wealthy, rather than focusing on mass-market offerings. This is evident in zooming sales of ultra-luxury gated housing and premium phones, even as their lower-end variants struggle. Affordable homes now constitute just 18% of India's overall market compared with 40% five years ago. Branded goods are also capturing a bigger share of the market. And the \"experience economy\" is booming, with expensive tickets for concerts by international artists like Coldplay and Ed Sheeran selling like hot cakes. Companies that have adapted to these shifts have thrived, Sajith Pai, one of the report's authors, told the BBC. \"Those who are too focused at the mass end or have a product mix that doesn't have exposure to the premium end have lost market share.\" The report's findings bolster the long-held view that India's post-pandemic recovery has been K-shaped - where the rich have got richer, while the poor have lost purchasing power. In fact, this has been a long-term structural trend that began even before the pandemic. India has been getting increasingly more unequal, with the top 10% of Indians now holding 57.7% of national income compared with 34% in 1990. The bottom half have seen their share of national income fall from 22.2% to 15%. The latest consumption slump, however, has deepened amid not just a destruction in purchasing power, but also a precipitous drop in financial savings and surging indebtedness among the masses. The country's central bank has also cracked down on easy unsecured lending that propped up demand after the Covid pandemic. Much of the consumption spending of the \"emerging\" or \"aspirant\" class of Indians was led by such borrowing and \"turning off that tap will definitely have some impact on consumption\", says Pai. In the short run, two things are expected to help boost spending - a pick-up in rural demand on the back of a record harvest and a $12 billion tax give-away in the recently concluded budget. It will not be \"dramatic\" but could boost India's GDP - largely driven by consumption - by over half a percent, says Pai. But major longer-term headwinds remain. India's middle class - which has been a major engine for consumer demand - is being squeezed out, with wages pretty much staying flat, according to data compiled by Marcellus Investment Managers. \"The middle 50% of India's tax-paying population has seen its income stagnate in absolute terms over the past decade. This implies a halving of income in real terms [adjusted for inflation],\" says the report, published in January. \"This financial hammering has decimated the middle class's savings - the RBI [Reserve Bank of India] has repeatedly highlighted that net financial savings of Indian households are approaching a 50-year low. This pounding suggests that products and services associated with middle-class household spending are likely to face a rough time in the years ahead,\" it adds. The Marcellus report also points out that white-collar urban jobs are becoming harder to come by as artificial intelligence automates clerical, secretarial and other routine work. \"The number of supervisors employed in manufacturing units [as a percentage of all employed] in India has gone down significantly,\" it adds. The government's recent economic survey has flagged these concerns as well. It says labour displacement as a result of these technological advancements is of particular concern for a mainly services-driven economy like India, where a significant share of the IT workforce is employed in low value-added services sectors that are most prone to disruption. \"India is also a consumption-based economy, thus the fall in consumption that can result from the displacement of its workforce is bound to have macroeconomic implications. If the worst-case projections materialise, this could have the potential to set the country's economic growth trajectory off course,\" the survey says.

        "headline": "12 things we spotted in the Oscars class photo",
        "author": "Steven McIntosh",
        "published_date": "1 hour ago",
        "summary": "Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, Demi Moore and Timothée Chalamet were among the actors smiling for the camera.",
        "content": "Ariana Grande, Timothée Chalamet and Demi Moore were among the Oscar nominees who gathered in Los Angeles on Tuesday for the annual \"class photo\". Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), the nominees from all categories were invited to mingle over dinner and cocktails, as an eventful awards race reaches its conclusion. The class photo, a highlight of the film calendar, is usually taken much earlier in awards season, at the nominees luncheon, but that event was cancelled this year due to the LA wildfires. Here are 12 things we spotted in this year's class photo: Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have spent the last few months crying, holding space and stroking each other's fingers as they promoted the screen adaptation of Wicked. The two actresses have redefined the film press tour in recent weeks thanks to their absolute adoration for each other - an energy they will have to recreate later this year when they do it all again for the release of part two. Before the photo was taken, instead of saying cheese, Erivo shouted: \"Everyone say 'Oscar nominee!'\" Last week, it was confirmed the pair will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony which will last a reported 10 minutes long. Wicked is the closest thing the Oscars have this year to a box office smash in the shape of last year's Barbie, and they'll be hoping the medley will recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year. We're aware the weather is getting warmer and the sun is rising earlier as we hurtle towards Spring, but we are nevertheless always on the lookout for a colourful cosy jumper and we need to investigate the origin of this one as an urgent priority. The woman with the impeccable sweater selection in the class photo is Maya Gnyp - a producer of I Am Ready, Warden - which is nominated for best documentary short. The film follows Texas death row inmate John Henry Ramire in his final days. Joining Ariana and Cynthia on the front row were fellow acting nominees Zoe Saldaña, Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro. Saldaña is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia Pérez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes. As a result, her fellow category nominees such as Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, have had to practice their best \"I'm just happy to be nominated\" faces this year. Madison, however, is a co-frontrunner in a tight race for leading actress. The Anora star is up against Demi Moore for The Substance in a category seen as a dead heat. James Mangold, nominated this year for A Complete Unknown, is one of Hollywood's most respected and loved directors. So why is he sitting on an aisle seat in the second-back row, away from all his pals, looking sheepish? It's probably because he only just made the class photo by the skin of his teeth, arriving late to the event to an affectionate collective groan followed by cheers from his fellow nominees. Despite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard. In a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating. They are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari. The movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan. Sitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race. In the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself. She is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown. Also hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile. The pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary. Sir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair. It's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year. Instead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley. Timothée Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown. In his speech, the actor talked about his desire to be \"one of the greats\" of Hollywood. However, the actor has not been campaigning as aggressively as frontrunner Adrien Brody, and for the class photo, Chalamet took an aisle seat, leaned out and put his fist to his chest. Seated just in front of him are Anora's director Sean Baker and his producer wife Samantha Quan. Adding further star power to the blurry back row were best actor contenders Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan. Brody is the frontrunner to win, for his role in the Brutalist as a Hungarian architect who moves to the US after World War Two and is taken under the wing of a wealthy businessman. Sing Sing star Domingo plays a prison inmate who joins a performing arts programme, while Stan is nominated for portraying a young Donald Trump. The Brits nominated in the acting categories this year are The Brutalist's Felicity Jones, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes. The actor was on Fiennes form, sitting in the back row alongside Sing Sing's John \"Divine G\" Whitfield. Fiennes is unlikely to win best actor, but if Conclave wins the top Oscar, he'll become the first actor ever to have appeared in four best picture winners. Understandably, not every nominee was available to attend the dinner - best supporting actor frontrunner Kieran Culkin was among the stars missing from the class photo. But others were conspicuous by their absence, most notably Emilia Pérez star Karla Sofía Gascón. The actress is persona non grata in Hollywood at the moment, after some historic tweets she posted resurfaced in recent weeks, severely damaging the film's awards chances in many categories. However, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself on Sunday - although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars. Sing Sing star Clarence Maclin was widely considered the most notable absence in the best supporting actor category this year. But he is still nominated at the Oscars thanks to his story credit on the film, which means he is recognised in the best adapted screenplay category. Maclin was one of the real-life inmates at the Sing Sing jail, after being sentenced to 17 years in jail for robbery, aged 29, and was a member of the prison's Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA) programme. In the class photo, Maclin, who plays a version of himself in Sing Sing, is either checking his watch or possibly about to sneeze.

        "headline": "US House narrowly passes Trump-backed spending bill",
        "author": "Mike Wendling",
        "published_date": "8 hours ago",
        "summary": "It is still several steps from becoming law, but marks a major victory for Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
        "content": "Republicans in the US House of Representatives narrowly passed a multi-trillion dollar government spending bill on Tuesday, a major boost for President Donald Trump that advances his 2025 agenda. The 217-215 vote was seen as a key early test for Republican House speaker Mike Johnson, who cancelled an earlier vote as it appeared he did not have enough support. Several Republicans wanted more fiscal discipline from a budget that includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, funded partially by spending cuts but also by potentially increasing the US government's substantial debt pile. But the bill eventually passed along party lines, with all Democrats voting against and just one Republican opposing it. That Republican was Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a prominent fiscal hawk who wanted deeper spending cuts. One Democrat did not vote. The House budget seeks $2 trillion in spending cuts over the next 10 years to pay for President Trump's agenda. It includes more than $100bn in new spending on immigration enforcement and the military. It would also extend tax breaks passed during his first term in office, which are due to expire at the end of the year. However there are still a number of steps the spending plan must go through in order to become law. The budget will have to be merged with a separate budget which is under consideration by the US Senate, in a process called reconciliation. And even if both chambers ultimately agree on a spending plan, many finer details will need to be negotiated before it can be sent to President Trump's desk to be signed. House Republican leaders initially delayed Tuesday's vote when it was unclear whether they would have enough support to pass the measure. Speaker Johnson and the second most senior House Republican, Steve Scalise, spent hours working to convince wavering party members to back the plan which, as well as tax cuts, would fund border security measures, deportations and military spending. Trump personally called some of the holdouts to encourage them to pass the bill, the two Republican leaders said. \"Trump helped us with a number of members,\" Scalise told reporters. \"Talking to anybody that we asked that really needed to clarify things.\" Three of the four party holdouts who had been initially seen as firm no votes - Representatives Tim Burchett, Victoria Spartz and Warren Davidson -  ultimately voted in favour. \"We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we are going to deliver the American First agenda,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the vote. \"We're going to celebrate tonight, and we'll roll up our sleeves and get right back in the morning.\" Democrats lined up to criticise the budget as a tax cut mostly for the wealthy, which they said would hurt low-income families who rely on the government-funded health care programme Medicaid. The party worked to get as many members in the chamber for the crucial vote, with Representative Brittany Petterson arriving with her son while on maternity leave. The Senate will be under pressure to take up the House's spending framework because President Trump has endorsed it, despite their separate bill which was introduced last week. General Sir David Richards said the decision \"almost certainly would not\" be happening if not for Trump. Donald Trump says the deal would give Ukraine \"the right to fight on\" in its war with Russia. The statue commemorates Colonel Robert A Smith, a Scot who was struck down in Kentucky during the US civil war. The Liberal Party of Canada will soon choose a leader that will replace Justin Trudeau and become Canada's next prime minister. \"They'll be extended an invitation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"They deserve to be down here.\" Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "headline": "How often should you poo?",
        "author": "Jasmin Fox-Skelly",
        "published_date": "1 hour ago",
        "summary": "The ideal poo is a 'type 3' or 'type 4' – cracked or smooth sausage – delivered once per day.",
        "content": "The ideal poo is a 'type 3' or 'type 4' – cracked or smooth sausage – delivered once per day. Are you a three-times a day kind of person, or is a trip to the lavatory a more rare and special occasion? And crucially, what does your poo frequency reveal about your health? Sit down, relax, and learn about the science of poop. How often we go for a number two can vary from person to person. Every time we eat, the large intestine contracts and pushes food along the digestive tract. This automatic \"gastro-colic reflex\" results in a the release of hormones that create the urge to poo, otherwise known as a \"call to stool\". Most of us have learnt to suppress this urge, however, meaning that once a day or less has become the new norm. \"We all tend to be too busy to poo,\" says Martin Veysey, a gastroenterologist and general medicine physician based at Canberra Hospital in Australia. Conventionally, it has often been claimed that one poo a day is a sign of good gut health. But in the past it wasn't known what constitutes 'normal' when it comes to bowel movements. One study even implied that anything from one bowel action every few weeks or months to 24 poos a day could be regarded as normal. However, thanks to the pioneering work of scientists like Ken Heaton, a consultant physician at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in the UK, we now known better. In the late 1980s, Keaton and colleagues surveyed residents of East Bristol, asking them the rather impertinent question – how often do you poo? The results revealed a huge variety in bowel movements. Although the most common bowel habit was one poo per day, only 40% of men and 33% of women adhered to this practice. Some defecated less than once a week, others three times a day. Overall, the study concluded that \"conventionally normal bowel function is enjoyed by less than half the population and that, in this aspect of human physiology, younger women are especially disadvantaged\". Incidentally this wasn't the only contribution Heaton made to the science of stools. He later helped devise The Bristol Stool Form Scale, which, with its accompanying illustrations, has become a widely used practical guide to help doctors diagnose digestive problems. The scale features handy descriptions of stools varying from \"separate hard lumps, like nuts\" to \"fluffy pieces with ragged edges\". The NHS and other health bodies state that having a bowel movement between three times a day and three times a week is considered normal. But normal and healthy aren't necessarily the same thing. Scientists might have solved the mystery of how often we poo, but it does nothing to answer the question how often should we poo? Increasingly, researchers are finding that a person's bowel movements are a strong indicator of their health. For example, a 2023 study examined the bowel habits of 14,573 adults in the United States. The most frequent bowel habit was seven times per week (50.7% of people), and the most common poo type was \"like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft\". Researchers then tracked the participants for over five years to see if there was any relationship between stool frequency and mortality. They found that people who pooed four soft stools a week were 1.78 times more likely to die within five years than those who pooed normal stools seven times a week. Infrequent defecators were also 2.42 and 2.27 more likely to die from cancer and cardiovascular disease, respectively. How much is a good amount to poop is also a question occupying Sean Gibbons, a microbiologist at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, the US. In 2024, Gibbons led a study which categorised 1,400 healthy adults into four groups based on their toilet habits; constipated (one-two bowel movements per week); low-normal (three-six bowel movements per week); high-normal (one-three bowel movements per day); and diarrhoea. They then looked to see if there was any association between poo frequency and a person's gut microbiome. Gibbons found that frequent pooers who squeezed out one to three stools a day had a higher proportion of 'good' bacteria residing in their guts than those who visited the lavatory less often. On the flip side of the coin, Gibbons found that people who pooed less than three times a week were more likely to have toxins in their blood that have previously been implicated in conditions such as chronic kidney disease and Alzheimer's. \"In the Goldilocks zone of pooing [the high-normal category], we saw a rise in strictly anaerobic microbes that produce chemicals called short chain fatty acids,\" says Gibbons. One of these short chained fatty acids (SFAs), butyrate, is known to lower inflammation in the body. This is important, because chronic inflammation is now thought to be the driving factor behind conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even Alzheimer's. \"Having higher levels of butyrate also allows you to control glucose levels in your blood better, so you have better insulin sensitivity,\" says Gibbons. \"Butyrate will also bind to cells in the gut, stimulating them to produce hormones that make you feel full,\" he says. Gibbons believes one reason people who were constipated had higher levels of harmful toxins in their blood stream is that when a person has infrequent bowel movements, poo sticks around in their gut for long periods. This causes bacteria in the gut to eat up all of the available fibre, converting it into health-promoting SFAs. The problem, however, is that once all the fibre is gone, the bacteria start fermenting proteins instead – which releases harmful toxins into the bloodstream. These toxins are known to cause damage to organs including the kidneys and heart. One, known as phenylacetylglutamine, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, for example. \"If you have chronically high levels of this metabolite in your circulation, it can promote atherosclerosis, a kind of hardening of the arteries and damage to the cardiovascular system,\" says Gibbons. Gibbons says that even though clinical guidance states that between three stools a day to three poos a week is healthy, his study showed that even in the low-normal stool group there was a rise in toxins in the bloodstream. \"It's hard to say definitively, because we don't have causal data to know whether these people went on to get sick in the future, but it does seem to be the case that, based on what we were looking at, pooping every other day to a couple of times a day is probably a better window to be healthy,\" says Gibbons. However, as ever, correlation is not causation. It is possible that people who are already less healthy in other ways might have less frequent bowel movements, although Gibbon's study tried to control for this by only selecting adults who had no reported health concerns. One measure of the health of your gut is the time it takes for food to travel through your digestive system – known as gut transit time. You can easily test this at home by eating brightly-coloured foods such as sweetcorn, and then timing how long it takes to come out the other end. Generally speaking, the longer a person's gut transit time, the less often they poo, and the more likely they are to suffer constipation. In 2020, researchers at King's College London gave blue muffins to 863 people to measure their gut transit time. This was part of the Predict1 study – a clinical research project focused on understanding how individual variations in genetics, gut microbiome, and other factors influence how different meals affect blood sugar and fat levels in the body. The study revealed that gut transit times varied widely from person to person, ranging from under 12 hours to many days. Remarkably, the microbes found in the guts of people with short transit times – who tended to defecate more often - differed remarkably from those with longer transit times, with a short transit time associated with a healthier gut microbiome. \"What we found was that people who had a longer transit time tended to have more 'bad' gut bacteria, so bacteria that have previously been linked to having worse heart health and metabolic health,\" says Emily Leeming, a microbiome scientist at King's College London. This finding was most pronounced for people with a gut transit time of 58 hours or more, who tended to poo less than three times a week. Like Gibbons, Leeming suspects that in those whose poo spends longer in the gut, microbes aren't getting a fresh meal – so they end up switching from eating fibre and carbohydrates to proteins. This then produces byproducts which are bad for your health. As well as a healthier gut microbiome, Leeming's study revealed that those with shorter gut transit times benefited from having less visceral fat – a type of fat that lies deep within the belly and surrounds abdominal organs. Visceral fat is dangerous because it can increase your risk of many health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. Finally, people with short gut transit times also displayed healthier responses to food, known as a 'postprandial response'. This means they had lower levels of sugar and lipids in their blood following a meal, lowering their risk of cardiovascular disease. The finding fits with what scientists know about constipation, and its links to chronic disease. If someone is chronically constipated, then they may be at higher risk of things like bowel cancer. However, the evidence to support this is mixed – one meta-analysis, a type of study which combines the results from several others which answer the same question, found that bowel cancer was not more prevalent in constipated individuals. \"But we also seeing links with other parts of the body. For example, people with Parkinson's Disease can have constipation up to 20 years before they show any motor symptoms,\" says Leeming. Veysey, meanwhile, points to the known link between slow bowel transit and gallstones – hard deposits of bile that form in the gallbladder. \"It also raises the risk of developing polyps, pre-cancerous lesions in the bowel, which then can become cancers,\" he says. Rather than the number of bowel movements a week – which can vary from person to person, Leeming says that the key thing to look out for is any unexplained changes in bowel habits. She also advises that it's a good idea to keep track of your regular pooping habits to get to know what's normal for you. \"We should all be looking at our poo, because it's basically like a free gut health test,\" says Leeming. \"It's not just how often you go, it's also colour and the shape of your poo as well. What you're really looking for is type 3 to type 4 [on the Bristol Stool Form Scale], which is basically a sausage with cracks in it, or a smooth sausage.\" As regards colour, if you see any black or red in your stools, that indicates the presence of blood. Although there could be a harmless explanation for this, it could be a sign of colorectal cancer and so it's important to see a doctor as soon as possible. You should also talk to your doctor if you regularly have diarrhoea or need to go very suddenly, or if you experience a lot of cramps, bloating, and gas after eating. Finally, if you'd like to become more 'regular', there's three simple things you can do. \"In our study, the people in the Goldilocks zone ate more fruits and vegetables, were more hydrated, and were more physically active,\" says Gibbons. -- For trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.

        "content": "The Jane Austen-hits-LA comedy changed fashion, language and cinema. As it turns 30 and a new stage musical version opens, its writer and director discusses why it's so personal to her. Back in 1995, Clueless offered a cheeky update of Jane Austen's Emma in a Los Angeles high school and, without even seeming to try, revolutionised how we dress and talk. Tartan and preppy chic are still huge (note the blazer and mini-skirt wore by Taylor Swift in London last August, or the pop star's yellow-and-black combo at an MTV awards do in September). Meanwhile, \"As if!\", the catchphrase of its heroine Cher, which originated as a piece of Californian slang, has become ubiquitous. Will you be spared the phrase in this article? As if! Because the film is brightly coloured and revolves around teenage girls, some critics at the time undersold the sharpness of its satire, which targets (among other things) white, west coast privilege, the plastic surgery industry, celebrity do-gooding, taboos surrounding menstruation, the cruelly low wages of teachers, and the kind of Nietzsche-reading liberal male who feels compelled to grow a goatee. The popularity of Clueless triggered a rash of insouciantly smart high-school-meets-classic literature movies (including 10 Things I Hate About You, Cruel Intentions, and Easy A, to name but a few). Just as importantly, it started a trend for films and TV shows that focussed on friendships between teenage girls. Thanks not only to the script but also a flawless cast and tip-top soundtrack (so much Radiohead), audiences of all ages found themselves rooting for salty protagonists, Cher, Dionne and Tai, who dominate the proceedings in a way that hadn't been seen before in a mainstream US film. Yes, there's a rom-com element to the plot, but it's the tensions between the girls that generate the most heat. Cher's complex interactions with Dionne and Tai paved the way for Buffy and Willow's textured relationship in the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Also, not to be bitchy, but without Clueless there'd be no Mean Girls. And Olivia Wilde cited it as an inspiration for her riotous directing debut, Booksmart, itself a modern teen movie classic. Yet 70 year-old Amy Heckerling, the film's writer-director, claims she had no idea Clueless would be a hit. \"Nobody is ever sure of that,\" she tells the BBC. \"Well, maybe some people are sure of it. Not me.\" Nor does she know if a new West End musical based on the film, for which she wrote the book, will click with audiences; it is currently running in previews ahead of an opening night in March. What matters, she says, is that she enjoyed working on both projects. She says of the musical, \"It will either work or it won't, but I'm loving doing it.\" As for the film, \"I have to admit, on that shoot I was happier than I've ever been. There were no big prima donnas. It was the closest I've ever come to imagining a movie in my brain and seeing it unfold exactly how I imagined.\" In the last three decades there's also been a three-season Clueless TV show, a book series, and another go at a stage musical, which premiered on Broadway in 2018. Still, it's the original film we keep coming back to and that Heckerling, Zooming from her home in New York, wants to discuss. As in Austen's 1815 novel, the plot revolves around a self-absorbed daddy's girl. Cher (Alicia Silverstone; putty-soft and irresistible) bombs around Beverly Hills with best-friend Dionne (Stacey Dash; poised), obsessed with matchmaking and make-overs. Cher is determined to \"help\" a new girl at school – dishevelled New Yorker Tai (Brittany Murphy; volcanically beguiling) – and proceeds to treat Tai like a toy. That is, until Tai fights back and Cher, her mind blown, realises that Tai is her equal. Which is where Heckerling veers off from Austen (whose heroine is ultimately horrified by her protege's \"notions of self-consequence\"). Here's the truth about Clueless. It's not as good as Emma. It's way better. Heckerling suspects that the film has such a loyal following (and keeps picking up new acolytes) because its \"two princesses\", Cher and Dionne, are so human: \"They rag on each other like real friends do.\" She thinks it's stayed relevant because space is given to characters who \"care about the environment\", including Cher's ex-step-brother, Josh, (played by sexy goofball Paul Rudd) and Cher's Greenpeace-supporting teacher, Miss Geist (a delightfully frazzled but unbowed Twink Caplan). Heckerling says, \"Having those people worry about stuff like that makes the audience relate to them. Well, that's what I've always assumed. I'm not a major activist, but I care about a lot of things.\" Heckerling is also proud of the film's many \"wonderful\" teens, some of them gay – like the closeted, blazingly charismatic Christian (Justin Walker) – others broke and scruffy, like lollygagging stoner Travis (Breckin Meyer). Born in the Bronx, to an often cash-strapped family, the pale and petite Heckerling has never felt like a top dog and happily acknowledges that her status as an outsider bled into Clueless's sly take on class conflict. She says that when she first went to California, to attend the American Film Institute, people made fun of how she talked. \"They'd go, 'Amy, you want some [she adopts a cartoonish New York accent] quawfee?' Their attitude was like, 'You're talking some old-fashioned, lower-class, New York language. What planet are you from?'\" On the one hand, it was wounding. On the other hand, she wanted to find a way to fight back: \"I didn't feel like I wanted to change how I spoke or who I was.\" Amy Heckerling's Five Culture Shifters Franz Kafka  Franz Kafka changed modern literature… OK, maybe Joyce did that, too, but wouldn't you rather read Kafka? It's not even like reading, it's like entering a nightmare with a sense of humour. And I think most adolescents can relate to waking up from troubling dreams to find they've turned into horrible vermin. The Twilight Zone When I was a teenager, everyone smoked pot daily, except me. I was addicted to The Twilight Zone, and pot made me worry the stories could come true. And some have. In Midnight Sun, it's always 120 degrees (49 Celsius) and the oceans dried up. How brilliant was Rod Serling? James Cagney  I first fell in love with Cagney when I was a toddler. He was a ball of energy, like Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck. When I was a teenager and interested in boys, he was my main crush. In film school, I appreciated his acting and I admire how he led his life. A Clockwork Orange and 1984 (the books and films)  I'm combining these because what I love is the language. I don't go a day without saying \"Free me glassies\". The future teen slang in A Clockwork Orange (Anthony Burgess) was stylish and thrilling. George Orwell's creation of \"Newspeak\" was genius. The language of 1984 was deliberately getting smaller because without words, there's no thinking, and therefore, no intelligent resistance. That's when she started keeping a notebook of all the new words used by her fellow students and, in the years that followed, any socio-economic tribes she encountered. She says she was especially interested in the \"very\" words – technically known as adverbs of degree, such as 'totally', 'majorly' and 'way' – \"because those 'very' words really define who you are, where you live and what year it is\". Which, of course, came in super handy for Clueless. Via the film, Heckerling demonstrates her complete mastery of LA lingo. At the same time, she finds a way to do justice to her own clique, aka earthy New Yorkers. Clueless immortalises a whole bunch of characters who use Big Apple vocabulary and/or talk with unapologetically broad New York accents; there's Tai, but also Christian, Cher's dad Mel (Dan Hedaya), and a driving examiner (Ron Orbach). Nor is it a coincidence that we're shown a hilarious clip of a \"Bronx-y\" Tony Curtis, looking most uncomfortable in Spartacus (or, in Cher-speak, \"Sporadicus\"). According to Heckerling, Curtis delivers his lines in the way he does (ie at a snail's pace) because he's trying to appear more \"classy\". It's a tactic she's tried herself. \"When you feel kind of insecure about your accent, you try to talk more slowly, as though that will get the Bronx out of it.\" The subliminal message sent by Clueless: Don't try to hide who you are. Own it. Some fans, however, have long believed Heckerling has herself concealed something very important about the film, namely Cher's Jewish identity. It's hard to ignore Cher's Jewish surname (Horowitz), or the mezuzah (a piece of parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah) on her family's front door. Yet, until now, Heckerling has been keen to shut down theories about Cher's ethnicity, pointing out that Cher's surname was originally meant to be Hamilton, and that Horowitz came from an ad lib by Wallace Shawn (as Cher's teacher). Heckerling is proud of her own Jewish roots, and as well as being in love with the Yiddish language (note Dionne's use of the word kvelling), she believes representation is incredibly important. So why, when it comes to Cher, does Heckerling not want to confirm what seems obvious? Whatever Heckerling's intentions when she was writing the script, the character we see in the film is coded as Jewish. If you know what to look for, it's as plain as, well, that mezuzah. Like someone preparing to put down heavy luggage, Heckerling sighs. \"I didn't want to say Cher was Jewish,\" she explains, because \"when you're Jewish, there's always some group that's going to be mad at you\". Another sigh. \"So you don't want to make a big thing of it.\" Heckerling claims that the most autobiographical scene in Clueless is the one in which Dionne (who, like Cher, has a somewhat kamikaze approach to driving) suddenly finds herself on the freeway and freaks out. Heckerling says that she identifies with the feeling of \"not being a very secure driver and suddenly you're in this situation where cars that are very big are coming right up and honking loudly. You're afraid to change lanes, because your car doesn't have the power to zip in and out and it's very frightening. I would often accidentally find myself on the freeway, just screaming till the exit was there!\" The image of Heckerling in her puny car, screaming her head off, is a comical one, but also feels like an apt metaphor for this film-maker's relationship with Hollywood. Pre-and-post Clueless, she was often made to feel as if she didn't belong in the big league (studios were stingy about budgets; bigwigs tried to bury her projects; she was continually messed around when it came to distribution). Which is crazy. Heckerling is actually responsible for two all-time classic films – her 1982 debut, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, launched the careers of Sean Penn and Jennifer Jason Leigh and successfully tackled taboo topics like teen abortion. On top of that, Heckerling created the massively successful franchise, Look Who's Talking (inspired by her own daughter, Mollie). The good news is that Clueless, an iconic juggernaut if ever there was one, has allowed Heckerling to keep going. Here she is, 30 years later, still holding her ground and her nerve. She has plenty of projects in the pipeline. She and Mollie have written a script for Look Who's Talking 4 and are now waiting for feedback. She's also researching a historical Jewish figure (\"I've made a million notes\"). And she would kill to work with Benedict Cumberbatch. Like her own, dearly departed mother (\"the original Cumberbitch!\"), Heckerling \"worships\" the British actor. \"Whenever I'm feeling crummy I'll put on Sherlock, or the Richard III he did for The Hollow Crown [BBC series of Shakespeare history plays],\" she says. \"I can't stand being in the sun. Or the desert. But if he said, 'Let's do a Lawrence of Arabia remake,' I'd be there.\" Serious money has been pumped into the new West End musical. In London, you can't miss the posters, which show Cher, hands on hips, in her yellow tartan suit. Heckerling is pleased with the show because it \"doesn't feel like a different animal\" to the film. \"Some characters have a little more presence than others but, if you like the film, I think you'll feel the show is telling essentially the same story\". Scottish-singer songwriter KT Tunstall, known for hits like Suddenly I See, did the score, while Glenn Slater came up with the lyrics, and their idea has been to create songs that together sound like a 90s mixtape, aping the sound of era-defining acts from Radiohead to Green Day to NSYNC. Heckerling says that she and Slater spent a lot of time working together. \"Me and Glenn would go through the lyrics, with me telling him what the characters were feeling. I'd sometimes tell him, 'Woah, she wouldn't say this!' and changes were made. But, basically, I was so pleased with what he was doing.\" She's all too aware that theatre is a different medium. \"In films, you get to do close-ups of people, you can get into their brains. In a musical comedy, the characters have to reach the last person in the audience with a song. Hopefully people will like the songs.\" The interview is almost over. So much has changed, Heckerling confides, since she made the 1995 film. She's concerned, these days, about censorship and surveillance, \"I'm worried about how much trouble you can get in to right now. It seems like Big Brother is watching everything you do.\" She calls out, mischievously, \"Hi Big Brother! We're just talking about a silly film!\" Memories of those \"wonderful\" days on the Clueless set spur her on. She says that many of her friends aren't working and \"don't even want to be working\". She tuts with amazement. \"It seems very strange to me. I can't imagine not wanting to…\" She searches for the right word, keen as ever to avoid sounding presumptuous or highfalutin. She says, \"I will always want to be creating. That's why you're alive, right?\" Clueless, The Musical is London's Trafalgar Theatre until 27 September 2025. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "headline": "Religious sect parents jailed over death of diabetic daughter",
        "author": "Simon Atkinson",
        "published_date": "2 hours ago",
        "summary": "Elizabeth Struhs was denied insulin by her parents, who believed God would heal her.",
        "content": "The parents of an eight-year-old diabetic girl in Australia who died after they denied her insulin for almost a week have each been sentenced to 14 years in jail for manslaughter. Elizabeth Struhs had in 2019 been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and her family was told she would need daily insulin injections. Her parents belonged to a religious sect known as The Saints, who opposed medical care, believing God would heal her. She died from diabetic ketoacidosis, which causes a dangerous build-up of ketones - a type of acid - and blood sugar spikes at her home in Toowoomba west of Brisbane in January 2022. Her father Jason Struhs and mother Elizabeth Struhs, were among 14 people convicted of manslaughter last month. The Saints' leader Brendan Stevens has been jailed for 13 years by the judge at the Supreme Court of Queensland, who called him a \"dangerous, highly manipulative individual\". Eleven other members were handed jail terms of six to nine years. Stevens and the girl's father had been on trial for murder but they were convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. All had pleaded not guilty. When handing down his almost 500-page verdict last mouth, Justice Martin Burns said that although it was clear Elizabeth's parents and \"every member of the church including all other accused\" had adored her, their actions had resulted in her death. \"Due to a singular belief in the healing power of God… she was deprived of the one thing that would most definitely have kept her alive.\" Elizabeth would have endured vomiting, extreme lethargy, and a loss of consciousness because she was denied medical care, prosecutor Caroline Marco said during the trial, which lasted several months and was heard by a judge sitting alone without a jury. Prosecutors called 60 witnesses and painted a picture of an \"intelligent\" child who suffered greatly in her final days. The congregation, meanwhile, had prayed and sung for the girl as she laid on a mattress and her condition deteriorated. Believing she could be brought back to life, the sect member made no effort to call a doctor, and authorities were not notified until 36 hours after her death, the court heard. \"Elizabeth is only sleeping, and I will see her again,\" her father Jason Struhs had earlier told the court. Stevens, 63, had defended the group's actions as faith-based and described the trial as an act of \"religious persecution\". He said that the group was within its \"rights to believe in the word of God completely\". Type 1 diabetes is a disorder in which the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin. It is characterised by uncontrolled high blood glucose levels and it can be controlled by injecting insulin. Elizabeth's sister Jayde Struhs had earlier said she had left the Saints and fled her family home at 16, after coming out as gay, and was now estranged from them. She and other witnesses described the congregation as having strict views, including that mainstream healthcare should be shunned and that both Christmas and Easter were \"pagan\" or ungodly festivals. The Saints are not affiliated with an established church in Australia and count around two dozen members from three families among its members. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "headline": "Myanmar villagers reveal 'desperate' illegal kidney sales",
        "author": "BBC Burmese",
        "published_date": "13 hours ago",
        "summary": "Two Burmese men tell the BBC they used forged documents and middlemen to undergo surgery in India.",
        "content": "\"I just wanted to own a house and pay off my debts - that's why I decided to sell my kidney,\" says Zeya, a farm worker in Myanmar. Prices had soared after a military coup in 2021 triggered civil war. He could barely feed his young family and was badly in debt. They all lived in his mother-in-law's house, in a village where thatched houses lined dirt roads, a few hours' drive from the country's largest city, Yangon. Zeya, whose name has been changed to conceal his identity, knew of local people who had sold one of their kidneys. \"They looked healthy to me,\" he says. So he started asking around. He is one of eight people in the area who told BBC Burmese they had sold a kidney by travelling to India. Illegal organ trading is a problem across Asia, and Zeya's story gives an insight into how it takes place. Buying or selling human organs is illegal in both Myanmar and India, but Zeya says he soon found a man he describes as a \"broker\". He says the man arranged medical tests and, a few weeks later, told him a potential recipient - a Burmese woman - had been found, and that both of them could travel to India for the surgery. In India, if the donor and recipient are not close relatives, they must demonstrate that the motive is altruistic and explain the relationship between them. Zeya says the broker forged a document, which every household in Myanmar must have, listing the details of family members. \"The broker put my name in the recipient's family tree,\" he explains. He says the broker made it appear as if he was donating to someone he was related to by marriage: \"Someone who is not a blood relative, but a distant relative\". Then, he says, the broker took him to meet the recipient in Yangon. There, he says a man who introduced himself as a doctor completed more paperwork and warned Zeya he would have to pay a substantial fee if he backed out. The BBC contacted this man afterwards, who said his role was to check whether a patient was fit to undergo the procedure, not to check the relationship between donor and recipient. Zeya says he was told he would receive 7.5m Myanmar kyats. This has been worth somewhere between $1,700 and $2,700 over the past couple of years - the unofficial exchange rate has fluctuated since the coup. He says he flew to northern India for the operation and it took place in a large hospital. All transplants involving foreign nationals in India must be approved by a panel called an authorisation committee, established either by the hospital or by local government. Zeya says he was interviewed, via a translator, by about four people. \"They asked me if I was willingly donating my kidney to her, not by force,\" he says. He says he explained the recipient was a relative and the transplant was approved. Zeya remembers the doctors administering the anaesthetic before he lost consciousness. \"There were no big issues after the surgery, except that I couldn't move without pain,\" he says, adding that he stayed in hospital for a week afterwards. Another donor, Myo Win - also not his real name - told the BBC he too had pretended to be related to a stranger. \"The broker gave me a piece of paper, and I had to memorise what was written on it,\" he says, adding that he was told to say the recipient was married to one of his relatives. \"The person assessing my case also called my mum, but the broker arranged a fake mum for the call,\" he says. He adds that the person who answered the call confirmed he was donating his kidney to a relative with her permission. Myo Win says he was offered the same amount of money as Zeya, but that it was described as a \"charitable donation\", and he had to pay the broker about 10% of the amount. Both men say they were given a third of the money up front. Myo Win says this was in his thoughts as he entered the operating theatre: \"I made up my mind that I had to do it because I had already taken their money.\" He adds that he \"chose this desperate way\" as he was struggling with debt and medical bills for his wife. Unemployment rates have climbed in Myanmar since the coup - the war has   ravaged the economy and sent foreign investors fleeing. In 2017, a quarter of the population were living in poverty - but by 2023, this had risen to half, according to the UN's development agency, UNDP. Myo Win says the broker did not tell him selling his kidney was illegal. \"I wouldn't have done it if he did. I am afraid of ending up in prison,\" he says. The BBC is not naming any of organisations or individuals involved in order to protect the anonymity and safety of the interviewees. However, another man in Myanmar, also speaking anonymously, told the BBC he had helped about 10 people buy or sell kidneys via surgery in India. He said he referred people to an \"agency\" in Mandalay in central Myanmar, which he said made arrangements. \"But don't worry about donors,\" he said. \"We have a list of donors who are queuing up to donate their kidneys.\" He too said documents were faked to label strangers as related by marriage. When asked whether he received money for his help, he did not answer. Organ transplants have increased by more than 50% worldwide since 2010, with about 150,000 carried out annually, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). But it says the supply of organs meets only about 10% of global need. Trading in human body parts is illegal in nearly all countries and is hard to measure. In 2007, the WHO estimated that 5-10% of transplanted organs came from the black market, but the figure may be higher. Illegal kidney sales driven by poverty have been documented in recent years across Asia, including in Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, Afghanistan, India and Bangladesh. India has long been a hub for medical tourism and concern there about kidney sales has been rising, following accounts in media reports and a recent police investigation. Last July, Indian police said they had arrested seven people in connection with an alleged kidney racket, including an Indian doctor and her assistant. Police allege the group arranged for poor Bangladeshis to sell their kidneys, using forged documents to secure approval for the transplants. Dr Vijaya Rajakumari, who had been working at the prestigious Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in Delhi, is alleged to have carried out the operations as a visiting consultant at a different hospital, Yatharth, a few kilometres away. Her lawyer told the BBC the allegations \"are entirely baseless and without evidence\", that she only carried out surgeries approved by authorisation committees and always acted in accordance with the law. According to her bail order, she is not accused of preparing forged documents. Yatharth Hospital told the BBC all its cases, including those managed by visiting consultants, \"are subject to our robust protocols to ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards\". \"We have further enhanced our processes to prevent any such occurrences in the future,\" the hospital said. After her arrest, Apollo Hospitals said Dr Rajakumari was a freelance consultant engaged on a fee-for-service basis and it had discontinued all clinical engagements with her. Dr Rajakumari has not been charged in court. Last April, a senior health ministry official wrote to Indian states warning of a \"surge\" in transplants involving foreigners and calling for better monitoring. Under Indian law, foreign nationals who wish to donate or receive organs must have their documents, including those showing the relationship between donor and recipient, verified by their own country's embassy in India. The BBC contacted India's heath ministry and the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization, as well as Myanmar's military government for comment, but has received no response. A public health campaigner in Myanmar, Dr Thurein Hlaing Win, said: \"Law enforcement is not effective.\" He added that potential donors need to be aware of the risks, including of bleeding during surgery and damage to other organs, adding that proper follow-up care is needed. The BBC last heard from Zeya several months after his surgery. \"I was able to settle my debts and bought a plot of land,\" he said. But he said he couldn't afford to build a house and had not been able to construct one while recovering from the surgery. He said he had been suffering from back pain. \"I have to restart working soon. If the side effects strike again, I have to deal with it. I have no regrets about it,\" he added. He said he stayed in touch with the recipient for a while, and she had told him she was in good health with his kidney. Speaking on condition of anonymity, she told the BBC she paid 100m kyats (between around $22,000 and $35,000 in recent years) in total. She denied that documents were forged, maintaining that Zeya was her relative. Six months after his surgery, Myo Win told the BBC he had paid off most of his debts, but not all. \"I have no job and not even a penny left,\" he said, adding that he had been experiencing some stomach problems since the surgery. He said he had no regrets, but then added: \"I am telling other people not to do this. It is not good.\" The 17-year-old had an additional set of limbs, buttocks and genitals that protruded from his abdomen.

        "headline": "Couple's trauma after body placed next to them on flight",
        "author": "Maia Davies",
        "published_date": "1 hour ago",
        "summary": "Cabin crew placed the body of a passenger who died mid-flight in an empty seat beside the pair.",
        "content": "An Australian couple have spoken of the \"traumatic\" moment the body of a dead passenger was placed next to them on a Qatar Airways flight. Mitchell Ring and Jennifer Colin, who were travelling to Venice for a dream holiday, told Australia's Channel 9 a woman had died in the aisle beside them during the flight from Melbourne to Doha. The couple say cabin crew placed her corpse, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the remaining four hours of the flight without offering to move him, despite there being empty seats. Qatar Airways said it apologised for \"any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused\", adding that it was in the process of contacting passengers. The couple said they had not been contacted or offered support by Qatar Airways or Qantas, the airline through which they booked the flight. They said there should be a protocol to ensure passengers onboard were looked after in such situations. Mr Ring told Channel Nine's Current Affair programme that staff had responded \"in no time\" when the woman collapsed, but that \"unfortunately the lady couldn't be saved, which was pretty heart-breaking to watch\". He said the cabin crew had tried to move her body towards business class \"but she was quite a large lady and they couldn't get her through the aisle\". Mr Ring said the crew had seen seats were available beside him. \"They said, 'Can you move over please?' and I just said, 'Yes no problem'. \"Then they placed the lady in the chair I was in.\" While Ms Colin was able to move to an empty seat nearby, Mr Ring said he had not been given the option to do so by cabin crew - even though there were vacant seats. When the plane landed four hours later, he said passengers were asked to stay put while medical staff and police came on board. He said ambulance officers had then started pulling blankets off the woman and he had seen her face. The couple said there needed to be a \"duty of care\" for customers and staff. \"We should be contacted to make sure, do you need some support, do you need some counselling?\" Ms Colin called the experience \"traumatic\" and said: \"We totally understand that we can't hold the airline responsible for the poor lady's death, but there has to be a protocol to look after the customers on board.\" In a statement, Qatar Airways said: \"First and foremost our thoughts are with the family of the passenger who sadly passed away on board our flight. \"We apologise for any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused, and are in the process of contacting passengers in line with our policies and procedures.\" A Qantas spokesperson said: \"The process for handling incidents onboard an aircraft like this is managed by the operating airline, which in this case is Qatar Airways.\" Barry Eustance, a former Virgin Atlantic captain, said deaths in the air \"occur more frequently than people would think\" but said as a far as he was aware there was no specific protocol in place for such situations. \"On a long haul flight it tends to depend largely on when it occurs and where it occurs and what the crew have in terms of facilities to place the body somewhere because on an aeroplane, there's no access to the hold, there's a crew rest area but that's for the crew so it can be problematical.\" A toilet area or galley area could be blocked off, he said, but the crew are required to keep a certain number of toilets available. Mr Eustance said that, while he was not being judgemental as he did not know the full situation, he was surprised that the crew did not move Mr Ring if there had been spare seats. \"I would expect the crew would do all they could to avoid that. You are creating potential future liabilities in terms of the trauma of the people next to whom the body was placed,\" he said. \"In my experience the crew would normally try to isolate the body, so there is no passenger exposure to the body and vice versa, for respect and privacy but also for medical reasons. You have a dead body that is uncontained and all that goes with it.\" Elizabeth Struhs was denied insulin by her parents, who believed God would heal her. Marty Sheargold said that the Matildas players reminded him of \"year 10 girls\". Australian authorities say there is \"no evidence\" that patients were actually harmed.

        "headline": "Chinese foodies pose as mourners to try funeral home's noodles",
        "author": "Koh Ewe",
        "published_date": "5 hours ago",
        "summary": "The noodle dish, provided only to mourners, has gone viral on Chinese social media.",
        "content": "Foodies in China have been reportedly flocking to an unlikely destination - a funeral home - after a noodle dish served at its canteen went viral on social media. The dish is found at the Erlong Funeral Home in the southwestern province of Guizhou. The canteen caters to the funeral home's customers, but as word began to spread about its noodles, hordes of diners - some posing as mourners - began showing up to try the food. Erlong has since announced it will allow some members of the public to eat at its premises, as long as they do not disturb genuine mourners. The funeral home offers various types of noodle dishes during breakfast and supper hours, which cost 10 yuan per bowl ($1.38; £1.09). The most popular type is reportedly the noodles topped with minced pork and peanuts. One Erlong worker told Jiupai News that they \"only served customers who come to the funeral home to handle matters\". But other people have been sneaking in to get a bowl of noodles, the worker said, adding that sometimes queues at Erlong are so long that diners sometimes have to wait a couple of hours to get their food. \"There have been people pretending to be relatives of the deceased, it's hard to tell them apart when it gets crowded, and it's hard to manage,\" he said. To meet the demand, the funeral home has since decided to offer 50 bowls of noodles to members of the public every day - for free - as long as \"they do not affect people's mourning\", according to Erlong's chef in an interview with local media. While the noodle dish was already popular among locals, the craze appeared to have ramped up earlier this month when a social media user posted about the dish while visiting a friend in Guizhou, which is known for its spicy and sour dishes. \"My friend says the food at this funeral home is so good,\" they wrote earlier this month on Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote. \"The queue for food is longer than the queue to lay flowers for the deceased.\" \"I didn't get to eat the noodles, because my friend's mum didn't know anyone who was holding a funeral service.\" Since then, many Chinese social media users have also shared their experiences eating the noodles. On Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, one user shared a photo of the dining hall's tickets, with what appeared to be a crowd queuing up for food. \"I heard the noodles here were very good,\" they wrote. \"I thought about how short life was, and got another bowl.\" China's naval exercise in the Tasman Sea has put Australia and New Zealand on alert, with Canberra calling it \"unusual\".

        "author": "Lindsey Galloway",

        "summary": "As the new US president makes massive governmental cuts, issues tariffs and leads an immigration crackdown, domestic and international tourism faces unprecedented changes.",
        "content": "As the new US president makes massive governmental cuts, issues tariffs and leads an immigration crackdown, domestic and international tourism faces unprecedented changes. In the United States, a new presidential administration always comes with policy shifts. But the dizzying speed with which President Donald Trump has issued executive orders and made sweeping federal changes during the first month of his second term has much of the world wondering what the long-term impacts of these changes might be, and what else is yet to come. By threatening and instituting tariffs on longtime allies, moving to overhaul the US immigration system, promising \"mass deportations\" and empowering unelected billionaire Elon Musk to fire thousands of federal employees and potentially shutter entire agencies established by Congress, Trump has come out swinging in his second act. And while these policy shifts are likely to have far-reaching social, political and economic implications, experts say they will also have a huge impact on the US travel industry. \"From immigration rules to trade wars, these changes will make travel to and within the US a lot more complicated and way less appealing. It's like putting up a giant 'Do not enter' sign just as the world is getting back into full travel mode,\" said Kristin Winkaffe, founder of travel firm Winkaffe Global Travel. \"If you make it harder for people to get visas, fewer people will come – it's that simple.\" This already appears to be playing out with the US's northerly neighbour. As Trump continues to threaten tariffs against Canada, even proposing annexing the entire nation, some Canadians have started boycotting US travel. The US Travel Association has warned that a 10% reduction in Canadian visits could result in more than $2bn in lost spending and 14,000 job losses. Yet, the new administration remains confident that its policy shifts will benefit travellers. \"President Trump has entrusted this team to work tirelessly to reaffirm American's [sic] complete confidence in the safety of our transportation systems,\" newly appointed US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. \"Our focus remains on ushering in a golden age of transportation while prioritizing the Department's core mission of safety and delivering innovative projects that move America.\" While the full scale of Trump's policy changes are yet to be seen, experts and travel professionals are keeping a close eye on the specific ways they may reshape travel. We spoke to some of them to find out how these impacts might affect domestic and international travellers. Perhaps no mode of travel has been more scrutinised in recent weeks than the aviation industry. In the past month, four fatal plane crashes in the US have led confidence in air travel to drop from 71% of Americans believing air travel is safe in January 2025, to 64% in February, according to a recent AP survey. Trump's recent policy changes aren't likely to improve this number. Air traffic control staffing was already under pressure nationwide and has been indicated as the cause of near-misses. Yet, even after investigations into the recent crash in Washington DC that killed 67 passengers found that air traffic control staffing was not at normal levels, Trump's administration began firing hundreds of Federal Aviation Administration employees last week. He has also fired the heads of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Coast Guard, and disbanded the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, leaving some wondering if aviation safety would continue to be a federal priority. The State Department also suspended all processing of passports with the X identity marker, leaving many non-binary Americans potentially cut off from international travel. More than 15 countries – including Australia, Canada, Colombia and India – allow citizens to amend their gender to non-binary or third gender, so it is yet to be determined how these visitors will be treated upon entry. In addition, more than 200 TSA employees have been laid off so far, and many expect screening times – especially among international visitors – to go up. Some LGBTQ+ travellers, in particular, are concerned about how recent policy changes will affect air travel. \"States like Texas, which is a hub for two of the three major US carriers, are looking at enforcing bathroom use in all public buildings (including airports) along the lines of the binary sex you were assigned at birth,\" said Lindsey Danis, creator of outdoor travel blog Queer Adventurers. \"Trans people would have to choose between complying with a law that would force use of the bathroom that aligns with their former gender or breaking the law and possibly being targeted for being in the 'wrong bathroom'.\" With Trump threatening to tariff Canadian oil starting in March, experts expect gas prices to rise as much as $0.15 per gallon, potentially putting a damper on holiday road trips. Some believe that the president's focus on increasing domestic oil and gas production may temper the effects of tariffs on domestic gas prices, but that may take longer to see at the pump. Even those with electric vehicles may have more trouble charging. Earlier this month, the Trump administration paused the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program, a clean energy initiative that had allocated billions of dollars for states to create electric car charging stations since 2021. Those hoping to drive to or through one of the US's spectacular national parks may also face extra challenges. President Trump recently fired 1,000 national park workers, leaving many to suspect that the staffing shortages will result in maintenance issues, shorter visitor centre hours and fewer amenities for travellers. Yosemite National Park, for instance, has already delayed its summer campground reservations. Similarly, federal funding for train travel seems to be an area that the Trump administration has eyed cutting. As part of recent spending freezes (some of which were temporarily rescinded recently), the US Department of Transportation is under scrutiny, in particular for its rail-related spending. Experts think this is likely to affect the $22bn in annual Amtrak funding, the development of high-speed rail corridors and intercity passenger rail service and grants for railroad safety programmes (which work to improve dangerous railroad crossings). More like this: • The Alabama museum grappling with the 'Gulf of America' • The only land disputed between the US and Canada • The Overseas Highway: The US's 'floating highway' It's not that rail is universally under attack, but some suspect that Trump may be looking to further privatise the industry. \"Right now, there's a bigger push for private companies to take the lead in rail investment, which could bring fresh ideas and innovation but also raises questions about accessibility,\" said public policy advisor Justin Goldsberry. \"Will ticket prices rise? Will service improve, or become limited in certain areas?\" The leisure and hospitality industry is one of the US economy's biggest sectors, employing more than 10% of the American workforce. But policy uncertainty hasn't been good for business, especially from international business travellers. \"The US is one of the largest markets for business events (especially exhibitions), and leading US shows rely on a solid share of international and overseas attendees,\" said Kai Hattendorf, CEO at the global business events company HTF and former CEO of UFI The Global Association of the Exhibition Industry. \"Policy uncertainty is disruptive for the sector, as event businesses crave predictability as they are planning years out, working with destinations and all actors from the travel and hospitality ecosystem.\" He points to tech event CES in Las Vegas this past January when visitors from certain countries, including China, were down significantly. Hattendorf is noticing a growing number of events reportedly cancelled due to funding pulled from US government agencies and divisions as they enact new policies. Other experts expect that as Trump's immigration crackdown looms, restaurants, hotels and – by extension – travellers are likely to feel the effects. \"The hospitality industry, one of the largest employers of immigrant workers, will take a direct hit if work visas like the H-2B become more restricted,\" said Neri Karra Sillaman, entrepreneurship expert at the University of Oxford and author of the forthcoming book Pioneers: 8 Principles of Business Longevity from Immigrant Entrepreneurs. \"Post-pandemic labour shortages nearly brought the industry to its knees. If we see another round of restrictions, expect rising costs, declining service and economic losses in major travel hubs like New York, Miami and Los Angeles.\" President Trump's executive order focusing on \"foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats\" also put visas for foreign nationals in jeopardy. The order directs the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State to implement enhanced vetting for both visa applicants and those currently in the country in order \"to ensure that those aliens approved for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans or [its] national interests\". This means delays for those applying for visas, and visa appointments are likely to be delayed or suspended. Legal experts suspect particular scrutiny of those from high-risk countries, and most suspect a similar travel ban as was enacted in 2017 to be enacted once more. \"For international travellers, heightened visa scrutiny and extended processing times could mean fewer visitors and billions in lost tourism revenue,\" said Sillaman. \"If the US makes itself a harder place to visit or do business, the rest of the world isn't going to wait. Other countries – Canada, the UK, Australia – are already rolling out policies to attract the talent that America risks turning away.\" This could be especially problematic because the US is entering what policymakers are describing as a \"mega decade\" of sporting events. In 2026 the US will co-host the FIFA World Cup in 11 American cities, followed by the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028, the Men's Rugby World Cup in 2031, the Women's Rugby World Cup in 2033 and the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City in 2034. Yet, a recent report by the US Travel Association put it bluntly: \"We're not ready to host the upcoming mega decade of events that will draw millions of domestic and international travellers.\" As US Travel Association CEO and president Geoff Freeman writes, slow visa processing times are the \"single biggest deterrent to visiting the US\". According to the State Department, wait times for visitor visas from certain nations such as Colombia can run up to 700 days, making it impossible for many travellers to attend next summer's FIFA World Cup. According to an Oxford Economics study cited in the report, if unaddressed, these days could result in a loss of nearly $19bn in spending in the next two years. \"America is staring at a historic opportunity,\" Freeman stated. \"The question is whether we will seize the moment or fall maddeningly short.\" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "From a lavish historical epic set in Sicily to a satire of Hollywood studios starring Seth Rogan, and the acclaimed final instalment of British Tudor drama Wolf Hall. It's right there in the title – you can't keep a Marvel hero down. Or off the screen. After three seasons originally made for Netflix (running from 2015 to 2018), the new Disney+ series brings back the familiar cast of heroes, villains and everything in between. Charlie Cox is Matt Murdoch, aka Daredevil, the blind attorney with superhuman senses that he had once used to fight crime at night, before giving it up at the end of season three. Vincent D'Onofrio is Wilson Fisk, the former mob boss known as Kingpin, now the mayor. \"Why did you stop being a vigilante?\" Fisk asks Murdoch over a friendly cup of coffee at a diner. No matter. That hiatus won't last much longer, as the punching, kicking and mask-wearing action begins. Jon Bernthal is Frank Castle, or Punisher, a brutal vigilante who, unlike Daredevil, never gave it a second thought. Daredevil: Born Again premieres 4 March in the US and 5 March in the UK on Disney+. Luchino Visconti's 1963 classic film, The Leopard, is still one of the most opulent, romantic, political-historical epics of all time, with Burt Lancaster as the Prince of Salina, head of a fading aristocratic family, and Alain Delon as his revolutionary nephew, Tancredi. Both are caught between the past and the future in 1860s Sicily during the upheaval that unified Italy into one country. Netflix has adapted Giuseppe di Lampedusa's novel, the basis for the film, into this lavish six-part series, cast largely with Italian actors and shot in locations throughout Sicily. Kim Rossi Stuart plays the Prince, the leopard of the title, clinging to his old ways. Saul Nanni is Tancredi, whose love affair with Angelica (Deva Cassel) forms the romantic centre of the story, even while revolutionaries storm the streets and Tancredi has to choose his own path, with his uncle or with a new order. The Leopard premieres 5 March on Netflix internationally In his consistently droll voice, John Mulaney has leap-frogged through genres, from a series of priceless stand-up specials to appearing in – and writing – instant-classic Saturday Night Live sketches like Lobster Diner, and last year's John Mulaney Presents: Everybody's in LA, a series of six live talk-show episodes presented over consecutive nights. At once sending up and using the tropes of an old-time talk show, Everybody's in LA was such a critical and popular hit that Mulaney returns with this 12-episode series, each show live once a week. Everybody's Live promises a similar meta/retro mix as the last run, which had some amazing, funny guests – David Letterman and Bill Hader on the same episode, a surprise appearance by Will Ferrell – viewer call-ins, and offbeat topics like coyotes in Los Angeles. Richard Kind returns in the role of announcer/sidekick, along with Saymo the delivery robot, in a show that is both goofy and satirical. Everybody's Live with John Mulaney premieres 12 March on Netflix internationally Stephen Graham is everything everywhere all at once these days (no bad thing). He plays a Victorian-era boxer in A Thousand Blows, which just premiered, and is both star and co-creator with Jack Thorne (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child) of this psychological drama which has an unsettling theme. Graham plays Ed Miller, whose 13-year-old son, Jamie, is accused of murdering a girl who went to his school. Ashley Waters (Top Boy) plays a detective investigating the murder, and Erin Doherty (the crime boss in A Thousand Blows) is the psychologist assigned to treat Jamie. Each of the four episodes is shot in one continuous take, playing out in real time, which might add to the tension. The real test will be how effective that strategy is. Adolescence is directed by Philip Barantini, who made the one-shot approach so effective in the 2021 film Boiling Point (which, need we add, stars Stephen Graham). Adolescence premieres 13 March on Netflix internationally In this drama that mixes elements of the police procedural with a family story of addiction, Amanda Seyfried plays Mickey Fitzgerald, a beat cop in Philadelphia assigned to the neighbourhood where she grew up, a place ravaged by the opioid crisis. When several women are serially murdered, she suspects the case might lead her to her sister, Kacey (Ashleigh Cummings), an addict and sex worker who has disappeared. The show weaves between past and present, with flashbacks to the sisters' fraught relationship and divergent paths, as Mickey deals with life as a single mother and with her increasing obsession with finding Kacey. The show has a lot to live up to. It is based on a bestselling novel by Liz Moore, who cowrote the series with its showrunner, Nikki Toscano. NPR called the book one of the Best of 2020, and if that's not enough, Barack Obama put it on his list of favourite books of the year. Long Bright River premieres 13 March on Peacock Ridley Scott directed the first episode of this crime series, which becomes more than the typical drugs-and-criminals thriller thanks to its lead actors. Brian Tyree Henry (Atlanta, If Beale Street Could Talk) and Wagner Moura (Civil War) play old friends in Philadelphia with a small-time scam. Posing as agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency, they pretend to raid drug houses while really searching for cash to steal. By the end of episode one, they have targeted the wrong meth lab, and are on the run from both real government agents and the dealers whose business they literally blew up in an explosion. Henry and Moura bring unusual sympathy to the characters as the show combines the tension of their life-or-death danger with the stories of the people they care about and try to protect. Henry's character is especially affecting in his love for the stepmother who raised him (Kate Mulgrew). Peter Craig, a co-writer of The Batman and Top Gun: Maverick, created the series, which has a gritty texture that recalls The Wire. Dope Thief premieres 14 March on Apple TV+ internationally Ellen Pompeo and Mark Duplass star as Kristine and Michael Barnett in a series  inspired by a tabloid-ready real-life case. The Barnetts adopt a seven-year-old Ukrainian orphan named Natalia Grace (Imogen Faith Reid), who has a rare form of dwarfism, and whose first adopted family has returned her. The trailer hints at a good deal of heightened drama, as Kristine begins to suspect that they do not know the truth about their child's age. \"Michael, I don't think she's a little girl,\" she says, a suspicion that eventually takes the couple all the way to court. Dule Hill plays a detective investigating the tangle of accusations and fears, and it is tangled. The actual events, which began in 2010, are so unusual and the saga so ongoing that it has already inspired three seasons of a documentary series on the Investigation Discovery Channel. Good American Family premieres 19 March on Hulu in the US and 7 May on Disney+ in the UK Netflix is calling this murder mystery from Shonda Rhimes's production company a  \"screwball whodunit,\" with Uzo Aduba as Cordelia Cupp, a brilliant detective investigating a murder in the White House during a state dinner. With a comic tone and a cast of 157 suspects, it's Upstairs Downstairs at the White House with a corpse, as Cupp questions everyone from the assistant usher (Susan Kelechi Watson) and the pastry chef (Bronson Pinchot) to the president's mother-in-law (Jane Curtain) and oldest friend (Ken Marino). Randall Park plays an FBI agent who investigates with Cordelia, and as the trailer reveals, Giancarlo Esposito plays the murder victim, who had the important job of chief usher and was not popular with his staff. The show was created by Paul William Davies, a writer on Rhimes's White House-set series Scandal, who has gone for a very different tone here. His goal for the show was to \"Keep it FUN,\" he told Netflix. \"I want people to be entertained, I want them to laugh.\" The Residence arrives in a very different political landscape to the one in which it was created, and it will be interesting to see whether finding laughter in the White House now lands as escapist entertainment or tone-deafness. The Residence premieres 20 March on Netflix internationally Viewers in the US have had to wait four months to see the series the Guardian called \"utter TV magic\" when it premiered on the BBC last November, but here it is. The second instalment of Wolf Hall, it is based on the last of Hilary Mantel's trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, the savvy but doomed advisor to Henry VIII. Just as Mantel set the standard for historical novels, the first Wolf Hall series, adapted from the first two books, did the same for smart, beautifully made historical TV dramas. Nine years later, the ensemble that put that first part together is back, on screen and off, with Mark Rylance as Cromwell, Damian Lewis as Henry and Jonathan Pryce as Cardinal Wolsey. The series was adapted by Peter Straughn, who was nominated for an Oscar this year for Conclave (he's good at writing men in robes) and directed by Peter Kosminsky. The story picks up in 1536, the blood still fresh from Anne Boleyn's head rolling, and although history tells us how badly it all ends, watching the court intrigue unfold here in such ravishing detail is exhilarating. Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light premieres 23 March on PBS in the US Hollywood studios are an irresistible target of satire, from Robert Altman's 1992 gem The Player to Armando Iannucci's recent series The Franchise. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the co-creators of this series, have now made them the subject of a very funny romp, overflowing with cameos from real-life actors and directors. Rogan plays Matt Remick, a production executive who longs to greenlight art films. That's an unlikely goal after he is promoted to head of Continental Studios, with the mandate to make commercial hits. One project his corporate bosses insist on: a film based on Kool-Aid. If a product-inspired movie worked for Barbie, why not a soft drink? The first episode includes cameos from Martin Scorsese and Steve Buscemi. Paul Dano, Olivia Wilde, Charlize Theron, Anthony Mackie and many others play outsized versions of themselves. And the casting of the regular characters is inspired. Ike Barniholtz plays Matt's second-in-command and best friend, Catherine O'Hara is the mentor whose job Matt took, and Kathryn Hahn the studio's brash head of publicity.

        "headline": "Five takeaways from Canada's Liberal leadership debates",
        "author": "Nadine Yousif",
        "published_date": "7 hours ago",
        "summary": "The Liberal Party of Canada will soon choose a leader that will replace Justin Trudeau and become Canada's next prime minister.",
        "content": "After back-to-back debates in both English and French, the candidates to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in Canada have made their case to voters. Card-holding Liberals will now choose between former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, House government leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis. Whoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year. A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\" Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates. How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates. Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans. He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population. Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs. But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\" Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US. Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems. Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation. Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living. Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money. But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care. As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth. Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity. Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling. \"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said. The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government. Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump. Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister. Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation. His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race. Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit. Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine. All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there. Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030. Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US. Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances. A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change. But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy. Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada. Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax. \"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said. Gould and Baylis, on the other hand, said they would keep some version of the consumer tax on carbon in place, saying that fighting climate change comes with a price. Donald Trump says the deal would give Ukraine \"the right to fight on\" in its war with Russia. \"They'll be extended an invitation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"They deserve to be down here.\" The petition accuses Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty, but has no legal force. It is still several steps from becoming law, but marks a major victory for Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson.

        "summary": "\"They'll be extended an invitation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"They deserve to be down here.\"",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has said he will invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House to celebrate their recent Super Bowl win, despite rumours that the champions may decline the invitation. \"Absolutely, they'll be extended an invitation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. \"They deserve to be down here, and we hope to see them.\" The Eagles skipped a visit to the White House when they won in 2018, but the team plans to attend the event this year, US media report. Rumours of the Eagles declining an invitation to the White House created a firestorm on social media after a weeks-old report from The US Sun resurfaced online. The Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 earlier this month, securing the team's second Super Bowl. Sports teams visiting the White House after winning a championship is a tradition that dates back to the 19th Century, but in the past decades some have used it to make a statement. Only one of the four teams that won the Super Bowl during Trump's first term in office made a trip to the White House. That was the New England Patriots in 2017. The Philadelphia Eagles did not go to the White House after their victory in 2018. The president said at the time that the players disagreed with his view \"that they proudly stand for the national anthem\", although the team or players never confirmed that as the reason. Instead, Trump invited a group of Eagles fans to a \"celebration of the American flag\". In 2017, NBA champions the Golden State Warriors were uninvited from the White House event by Trump after star player Stephen Curry said he did not want to go. The Warriors were not invited when they won the NBA Championship again in 2018. There were, however, some memorable sporting visits to the White House under Trump. He famously welcomed Clemson University's football team in 2018 with burgers from McDonald's, Wendy's and other fast food restaurants. Louis Moore, a professor of history at Grand Valley State University, told the BBC that these celebratory visits to the White House are political, even if they do not initially seem that way. \"For some guys [going to the White House] is a lifelong dream,\" he said. \"But in basketball and football and women's soccer,  it's definitely political. The idea not to go is political, and even the idea to go is political.\" He added that the event has become even more political since Trump's first election victory in 2016. \"Early on in Trump's presidency, teams weren't going to the White House. Before that, there were no announcements,\" he said. \"But now you see people announcing that they're not going.\" Mr Moore said that every presidential candidate since the 1930s has sought an athlete's endorsement. \"Presidents want to be around winners, and winners want to be around the president,\" he said. Trump is not the only president who has been snubbed by sports teams and players. NBA legend Larry Bird declined to visit Ronald Reagan in the White House after becoming an NBA champion with the Boston Celtics in 1984. \"If the president wants to see me, he knows where to find me,\" he said. In 2013, Matt Birk of the Baltimore Ravens declined to visit the White House celebration because he opposed Barack Obama's stance on abortion. According to CBS Sports, Birk complained of an Obama speech where the president had said \"God bless Planned Parenthood\". Donald Trump says the deal would give Ukraine \"the right to fight on\" in its war with Russia. The statue commemorates Colonel Robert A Smith, a Scot who was struck down in Kentucky during the US civil war. The Liberal Party of Canada will soon choose a leader that will replace Justin Trudeau and become Canada's next prime minister.

        "summary": "The petition accuses Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty, but has no legal force. ",
        "content": "Hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition to revoke Elon Musk's Canadian citizenship amid tensions between the Trump administration and Canada. The petition, which opened to signatures five days ago, accuses Mr Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty. In Canada, citizenship can be revoked only if someone has committed fraud, misrepresented themselves or knowingly hid information on an immigration or citizenship application. Mr Musk, who was born in South Africa, holds both Canadian and US citizenship. Responding to the petition, the billionaire wrote on X: \"Canada is not a real country.\" The post was later deleted. The petition claims the billionaire \"has used his wealth and power to influence our elections\" and \"has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty\". Mr Musk has Canadian citizenship through his mother, who was born in Saskatchewan. Launched on 20 February, the petition, already signed by more than 250,000 Canadians, remains open for signatures until 20 June. It is mostly symbolic and has no legal force. But petitions with at least 500 signatures and a member of parliament's backing typically receive a government response, this one may not, as a spring election could dissolve parliament. It was created by a British Columbia author and endorsed by MP Charlie Angus of the New Democratic Party. Angus, a 20-year MP for Timmins–James Bay, has announced he will not seek re-election. The BBC has contacted his office for comment. US-Canada tensions have escalated since Trump's return, with the president repeatedly suggesting Canada could become a US state and threatening tariffs on steel, aluminium, and other imports. Canadian leaders have pushed back, vowing counter-tariffs. The spat has spilled out beyond government, with Canadians cancelling US trips, boycotting American products, and booing opposing anthems at hockey and basketball games. Mr Musk moved to Canada from South Africa at 18, and worked odd jobs before studying at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. He later emigrated to the US. The billionaire has backed Trump's hardline immigration policies but now faces scrutiny over claims he worked illegally in the US on a student visa. In a recent interview, Steve Bannon, a former advisor to President Trump, called Mr Musk a \"parasitic illegal immigrant\". The Tesla CEO has denied the accusations, and has said he did not work illegally. He became a naturalised US citizen in 2002, according to a recent biography. The BBC has contacted Mr Musk via his businesses for comment. Donald Trump says the deal would give Ukraine \"the right to fight on\" in its war with Russia.

        "headline": "White House takes control of press pool that covers Trump",
        "author": "Bernd Debusmann Jr",
        "published_date": "11 hours ago",
        "summary": "It will determine which outlets participate in the rotating pool that reports from the Oval Office and Air Force One.",
        "content": "The White House plans to determine which news outlets have access to President Donald Trump, taking control from an association of journalists after more than a century. The changes, announced by Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday, mean the White House will determine which outlets participate in the \"pool\" that covers presidential events and shares material with other media outlets. The rotation of pool reporters was previously determined by the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA), which said the decision \"tears at the independence of a free press\". The surprise announcement comes as the Associated Press fights to restore its access to presidential events after it was blocked. \"The White House press team in this administration will determine who gets to enjoy the very privileged and limited access in spaces such as Air Force One and the Oval Office,\" Leavitt said at a news briefing on Tuesday. She said the changes would allow \"new media\" outlets - including streaming services and podcasts - to \"share in this awesome responsibility\". \"Legacy media outlets who have been here for years will still participate in the pool, but new voices are going to be welcomed in as well,\" she said. \"[By] deciding which outlets make up the limited press pool on a day-to-day basis, the White House will be restoring power back to the American people,\" Leavitt added. Founded in 1914, the WHCA has historically handled some logistics around day-to-day coverage of the president, most notably the \"pool\" of reporters, which includes a camera crew from one of the five major US networks, a radio correspondent and a rotating group of print outlets. The WHCA has long claimed the pool is beneficial both for the president - who is able to quickly disseminate news - as well as for the wider media who receive pool reports, photographs, video and audio. Pool reporters are on-duty every day - including weekends and holidays - both at the White House or when the president is travelling. BBC News is among the outlets that participate in the radio pool. The WHCA expressed concern that the move will benefit the White House by giving access to news outlets that it sees as sympathetic or friendly. \"This move does not give power back to the people - it gives power to the White House,\" Fox News reporter Jacqui Heinrich, a WHCA board member, wrote on X. In its own statement, the WHCA said that the decision \"suggests the government will choose the journalists who cover the president\". The WHCA said it was not given any notice about the White House's decision before Tuesday's news briefing. Leavitt, meanwhile, said the WHCA would no longer have a \"monopoly\" on controlling the pool. President Trump was asked about the announcement in the Oval Office later on Tuesday. \"We're going to be calling those shots,\" he said of the changes. Earlier this week, a US judge declined a request by the Associated Press to immediately restore its access to presidential events after the Trump administration blocked the agency in a dispute over the term \"Gulf of America\". The news agency has refused to change its style from the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America\", after President Trump renamed it with an executive order. The AP argues the ban is retaliatory and infringes on First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and the press. The ban has meant that the AP - which hundreds of news outlets rely on - has been unable to access press events alongside the rest of the pool at the White House as well as Air Force One. A hearing has been scheduled for 20 March. Donald Trump says the deal would give Ukraine \"the right to fight on\" in its war with Russia. The statue commemorates Colonel Robert A Smith, a Scot who was struck down in Kentucky during the US civil war.

        "author": "David Gritten",
        "published_date": "14 hours ago",
        "summary": "Five newborns and a two-month-old have reportedly died, with doctors blaming a lack of shelter and heating.",
        "content": "At least six babies have died in the past two weeks in Gaza due to the cold weather and lack of adequate shelter and heating, Palestinian medics and health officials say. Doctors at the Patient's Friends Benevolent Society hospital in Gaza City, in the north, said nine newborn babies suffering from cold injuries had been admitted, five of whom had died, with one other in a critical condition. The family of a two-month-old girl also said she had died due to the cold near the southern city of Khan Younis overnight. The PFBS hospital called for the urgent delivery of caravans and fuel to improve conditions for the estimated 945,000 displaced Palestinians living in tents and makeshift shelters. The Palestinian armed group Hamas has accused Israel of failing to allow in agreed amounts of tents, caravans and other shelter supplies during a ceasefire that began five weeks ago. Israel has denied this. Most of Gaza's 2.1 million population has been displaced multiple times during the 16-month war between Israel and Hamas and almost 70% of buildings in the territory are estimated to be damaged or destroyed. The healthcare system has also collapsed, with only 18 of the 35 hospitals partially functional and shortages of essential medical equipment. According to meteorological websites, the night-time temperature in Gaza has regularly fallen below 10C (50F) over the past two weeks. It dropped to 3C (37F) on Monday night, after the PFBS hospital's medical director Dr Saeed Salah had warned in a video that three babies suffering from cold injuries, including hypothermia, had died over the same period. He said the babies were only one or two days old, and had weighed between 1.7kg and 2kg (3.7-4.4lbs). On Tuesday, Dr Salah and a paediatrician at the hospital, Dr Samer Lubad, reported that another two newborns had died. \"The last several weeks we [had] nine neonates in our hospital. And they came with case that they call 'cold injury' or hypothermia,\" Dr Lubad told Al Jazeera TV. \"Three babies survived and were treated successfully and discharged home. There is still one baby in our neonatal ICU in a critical general condition.\" He added: \"Of course, this condition is because of the cold weather and lack of safe shelters, lack of central heating, and lack of electricity in the Gaza Strip.\" Meanwhile, the head of the paediatric department at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis told the Associated Press that it had received the body of a two-month-old girl who had died of hypothermia on Tuesday. A video posted by a local journalist appeared to show the girl being buried by her father and uncle, who said she was named Sham Yousef al-Shambari. He said she had been healthy and that her mother had found her \"stiff as wood from the cold\" when she tried to wake her for feeding during the night inside the family's tent in the al-Mawasi area. Dr Muneer al-Boursh, director general of the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, said in a statement a total of 15 children had died due to the cold since the start of the winter. He also alleged that Israel had \"failed to comply with humanitarian protocols, including allowing the entry of medical equipment, heating supplies, tents, and mobile homes\" since the ceasefire began on 19 January. Hamas has previously said that Israel was required to allow in about 300,000 tents and 60,000 caravans during the six-week-long first phase of the deal. Israeli military body Cogat said Israel was \"committed to and complies with the obligation to allow the entry of 4,200 humanitarian aid trucks per week\" into Gaza, including those carrying tents and shelter supplies. \"Based on the data available to us, hundreds of thousands of tents have entered the Gaza Strip since the agreement came into effect,\" it added. It comes amid continued uncertainty over whether the ceasefire will continue past Saturday, when the deal's first phase is set to expire. On Sunday, Israel postponed the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in exchange for 10 hostages who had been handed over by Hamas, accusing the group of cynically using its hostages for propaganda purposes. Hamas accused Israel of a \"blatant\" violation of the deal and said indirect talks about further steps, including on the deal's second phase, were conditional on the prisoners being released. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. At least 48,348 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry. Australian authorities say there is \"no evidence\" that patients were actually harmed. The announcement could make conflict between Israel and the new leadership in Syria more likely. Israel's defence minister says the camps are now \"empty\" and would be occupied by the Israeli military. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indefinitely delayed the release of what would have been the biggest group of Palestinian prisoners so far Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the prisoners won't be freed until the next release of hostages is guaranteed.

        "headline": "Hamas says no Gaza ceasefire talks unless Israel releases prisoners",

        "published_date": "2 days ago",
        "summary": "Israel postponed the release of 600 Palestinians, accusing Hamas of \"humiliating\" hostage handovers.",
        "content": "Hamas says talks with Israel about further steps in the Gaza ceasefire deal are conditional on Palestinian prisoners being freed as agreed. Israel said on Sunday it was delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinians in return for six living and four dead hostages who had been freed, accusing Hamas of repeated violations including \"humiliating\" handover ceremonies. A senior Hamas official said the decision exposed the entire agreement to \"grave danger\" and called on mediators, especially the US, to pressure Israel. The deal's first phase and temporary six-week truce is set to expire on Saturday but indirect negotiations on the second phase and an end to the war have not yet begun. UN Secretary General António Guterres warned that the ceasefire was \"precarious\" and that a resumption of hostilities must be avoided at all costs. He also called for the \"dignified release of all remaining hostages\". On Saturday - the start of the sixth and final week of the ceasefire deal's first phase - Hamas released six living Israeli hostages. As with many of the previous handovers, five of them were led onto stages beside armed fighters before being transferred to the Red Cross and then taken to Israel. Later, Hamas posted a video of two other hostages in a vehicle watching one of the handover ceremonies and appearing to plead with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get them out too. A forum representing the hostages' families condemned the video as a \"sickening display of cruelty\". There was already fury in Israel after Hamas  returned the bodies of four hostages earlier in the week, including those of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons Ariel and Kfir, who were abducted during the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel. It emerged on Friday that Hamas had handed over the remains of a Palestinian woman rather than those of Ms Bibas. The group said there had been a mistake and transferred Ms Bibas's body later that day. Israeli authorities also said a post-mortem had shown that Ariel and Kfir's captors killed the boys \"with their bare hands\", contradicting Hamas's claim that they died in an Israeli air strike. Israel was scheduled to free 620 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the 10 hostages. More than 400 were Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war, while 50 of the prisoners were serving life sentences in Israeli jails. They had reportedly already boarded buses at a prison in the occupied West Bank when the order came to suspend their release while Netanyahu consulted ministers. In the early hours of Sunday, the prime minister's office said the release would be postponed \"in light of Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes\". \"It has been decided to delay the release of terrorists that was planned for yesterday until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies.\" Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - denounced Israel's decision as a \"blatant violation\" of the deal and warned US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that there could be no talks on extending the ceasefire until the prisoners were released. \"We have conveyed a clear and strong message to the mediators - we cannot continue discussing any further steps if these 620 Palestinians are not released,\" Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Monday. Asked if the scheduled release of the bodies of another four Israeli hostages on Thursday could be affected, he replied that \"all options are on the table\". \"Before going to the next step, we have to be sure that the past step [will happen],\" he added. \"Netanyahu is clearly sending strong messages that he is intentionally sabotaging the deal, he is preparing the atmosphere for returning back to the war. Therefore, what are the guarantees that he might take the other four bodies and again not release the agreed-upon number of Palestinians, plus the 620 Palestinians?\" Naim said Hamas had discussed Israel's complaints about the hostage handover ceremonies, but denied they had been humiliating and alleged that Israeli authorities had mistreated Palestinian prisoners before they were released. The White House backed Israel's decision to delay the prisoner release, saying it was an \"appropriate response\" to what it called the \"barbaric treatment\" of hostages by Hamas. But President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said he would travel to the region this week with the aim of getting \"an extension of phase one\". \"We're hopeful that we have the proper time... to begin phase two, and finish it off and get more hostages released,\" he told CNN on Sunday. A total of 33 Israeli hostages are supposed to be exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza during the ceasefire deal's first phase. So far, 25 living hostages and four dead hostages have been released, while the bodies of the last four hostages are scheduled to be handed over this week. Five living Thai hostages have also been freed outside the deal. The agreement has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been allowed to return to their homes in the north and hundreds of aid lorries are now being allowed into the territory each day. The ceasefire's second phase should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. At least 48,346 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter. Australian authorities say there is \"no evidence\" that patients were actually harmed. Five newborns and a two-month-old have reportedly died, with doctors blaming a lack of shelter and heating. The announcement could make conflict between Israel and the new leadership in Syria more likely. In 2008, Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert urged the Palestinian leader to agree to a two-state solution. The map he drew has never been revealed to media - until now. Israel's defence minister says the camps are now \"empty\" and would be occupied by the Israeli military. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "author": "Paul Adams",
        "published_date": "2 days ago",
        "summary": "In 2008, Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert urged the Palestinian leader to agree to a two-state solution. The map he drew has never been revealed to media - until now.",
        "content": "\"In the next 50 years, you will not find one Israeli leader that will propose to you what I propose to you now. \"Sign it! Sign it and let's change history!\" It was 2008. Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was imploring the Palestinian leader to accept a deal he believed could have brought peace to the Middle East. It was a two-state solution - a prospect which seems impossible today. If implemented, it would have created a Palestinian state on more than 94% of the occupied West Bank. The map Olmert had drawn up now has an almost mythical status. Various interpretations have appeared over the years, but he has never revealed it to the media. Until now. In Israel and the Palestinians: The Road to 7th October, the latest series from documentary filmmaker Norma Percy available on iPlayer from Monday, Olmert reveals the map he says he showed to Mahmoud Abbas at a meeting in Jerusalem on 16 September 2008. \"This is the first time that I expose this map to the media,\" he tells the filmmakers. It shows, in detail, the territory which Olmert proposed to annexe to Israel - 4.9% of the West Bank. That would have included major Jewish settlement blocs - just like previous proposals dating back to the late 1990s. In return, the prime minister said Israel would give up an equal amount of Israeli territory, along the edges of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The two Palestinian territories would be connected via a tunnel or highway – again, something that had been discussed before. In the film, Olmert recalls the Palestinian leader's response. \"He said: 'Prime minister, this is very serious. It is very, very, very serious.'\" Crucially, Olmert's plan included a proposed solution to the thorny issue of Jerusalem. Each side would be able to claim parts of the city as their capital, while administration of the \"holy basin\" - including the Old City, with its religious sites, and adjacent areas - would be handed over to a committee of trustees consisting of Israel, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the US. The implications of the map, for Jewish settlements, would have been colossal. Had the plan been implemented, dozens of communities, scattered throughout the West Bank and Jordan Valley, would have been evacuated. When the previous Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, forcibly removed a few thousand Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005, it was regarded as a national trauma by those on the Israeli right. Evacuating most of the West Bank would have represented an infinitely greater challenge, involving tens of thousands of settlers, with the very real danger of violence. But the test never came. At the end of their meeting, Olmert refused to hand over a copy of the map to Mahmoud Abbas unless the Palestinian leader sign it. Abbas refused, saying that he needed to show his experts the map, to make sure they understood exactly what was being offered. Olmert says the two agreed to a meeting of map experts the following day. \"We parted, you know, like we are about to embark on a historic step forward,\" Olmert says. The meeting never happened. As they drove away from Jerusalem that night, President Abbas's chief of staff, Rafiq Husseini, remembers the atmosphere in the car. \"Of course, we laughed,\" he says in the film. The Palestinians believed the plan was dead in the water. Olmert, embroiled in an unrelated corruption scandal, had already announced that he was planning to resign. \"It is unfortunate that Olmert, regardless of how nice he was… was a lame duck,\" Husseini says, \"and therefore, we will go nowhere with this.\" The situation in Gaza also complicated matters. After months of rocket attacks from the Hamas-controlled territory, Olmert ordered a major Israeli assault, Operation Cast Lead, at the end of December, triggering three weeks of intense fighting. But Olmert tells me it would have been \"very smart\" for Abbas to sign the deal. Then, if a future Israeli prime minister tried to cancel it, \"he could have said to the world that the failure was Israel's fault\". Israeli elections followed in February. Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu, a vocal opponent of Palestinian statehood, became prime minister. Olmert's plan, and map, faded from view. The former prime minister says he's still waiting for Abbas's reply, but his plan has since joined a long list of missed opportunities to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In 1973, the former Israeli diplomat, Abba Eban, quipped that the Palestinians \"never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity\". It's a phrase that Israeli officials have frequently repeated in the years since. But the world is more complicated than that, especially since the two sides signed the historic Oslo Accords in 1993. The peace process ushered in by a handshake on the White House lawn between former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had moments of genuine hope, punctuated by tragedy. Ultimately, it resulted in failure. The reasons are complex and there's plenty of blame to go around but in truth, the stars were never properly aligned. I witnessed this non-alignment at first hand 24 years ago. In January 2001, at the Egyptian resort of Taba, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators once again saw the outlines of a deal. A member of the Palestinian delegation drew a rough map on a napkin and told me that, for the first time, they were looking at the rough outlines of a viable Palestinian state. But the talks were irrelevant, drowned out by the violence raging on the streets of the West Bank and Gaza, where the second Palestinian uprising, or \"intifada\", had erupted the previous September. Once again, Israel was in the midst of a political transition. Prime Minister Ehud Barak had already resigned. Ariel Sharon comfortably defeated him a few weeks later. The map on the napkin, just like Olmert's map eight years later, showed what might have been. The delayed release of 600 Palestinian prisoners will reportedly go ahead when Hamas returns four Israeli hostages' bodies. Australian authorities say there is \"no evidence\" that patients were actually harmed. Five newborns and a two-month-old have reportedly died, with doctors blaming a lack of shelter and heating. The announcement could make conflict between Israel and the new leadership in Syria more likely. Israel postponed the release of 600 Palestinians, accusing Hamas of \"humiliating\" hostage handovers.

        "headline": "Trump accelerated UK military boost, says former defence chief",
        "author": "Jennifer McKiernan",
        "published_date": "49 minutes ago",
        "summary": "General Sir David Richards said the decision \"almost certainly would not\" be happening if not for Trump.",
        "content": "The decision to hike UK defence spending has been \"accelerated\" by President Donald Trump's actions on Ukraine, a former defence chief of staff has said. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced the UK would reallocate aid funds to boost military spending to 2.5% by 2027, following Trump's demand that all European allies increase their defence contributions. Defence Secretary John Healey defended the decision, saying \"hard power is now more important than soft power\", despite an outcry from charities and aid groups. The decision comes as Sir Keir is set to fly to the US for talks with Trump in the White House, to discuss the war in Ukraine. General Sir David Richards, a former chief of defence staff, said the decision to raise  defence spending over the next two years was a sound strategic move, but one that \"almost certainly would not\" be happening if not for Trump. \"It was going to happen, it's now been accelerated by Donald Trump's actions, and all of us, I think, would say not before time,\" he told  BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Praising Healey as a \"forward-thinking, strategically-minded person\", he added: \"The one thing I've learned as a student of military history, but also from my own experience, you've got to keep close to America if you want to be genuinely credible in terms of deterring a potential aggressor. \"There is no way that Europe, at the moment, could worry Russia, for example.\" Lord Richards stressed the British Army was currently \"very hollowed out indeed\" and suggested the \"army isn't big enough\" currently for British troops to be part of a rotation of European peacekeeping forces. Questions have been raised about the Labour government's U-turn on its manifesto pledge to raise international development funding by 0.2% of GDP, with unease among some Labour MPs about the move. Asked whether the increase announced on Tuesday is linked to Sir Keir's visit to the White House, Healey told the Today programme: \"President Trump, over the last two weeks, has been very direct in his challenge. \"He's reinforced the imperative and the importance of Britain making this commitment and helping other European countries to step up in a similar way.\" The US has been warning European leaders it wants to see a significant increase in their defence contributions to Nato for at least a decade. Trump's rapprochement with Russia's Vladimir Putin, and the US siding with Russia on a UN resolution on Ukraine, has sent shockwaves through European allies. Asked whether he believed the UK increasing its defence contribution would bring Trump on side, Healey said: \"I've never had any doubt that President Trump and the US administration... recognise that the UK is the US's closest defence and security ally -  they've challenged us to help lead in Europe.\" He added the PM could now tell Trump: \"You are challenging Europe and the UK to step up on European security, on Ukraine, on defence spending, on reinforcing our industrial base. \"We are, and we will step up further.\" The UK would still spend £9bn on international aid, including in Gaza, Healey insisted, prioritising efforts to \"deter conflicts that cause the biggest impact on many of the poorest countries\". However, the defence secretary said \"the definition of defence numbers can be done in different ways\" when pressed on whether Sir Keir's claim the 0.2% increase was worth £13.4bn every year. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he suggested the real-terms increase in defence spending is \"something over £6bn\" when taking inflation into account and the PM's £13.4bn figure was \"the increase in hard cash that will be spent on defence in two years' time compared to what's being spent today\". However, shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge accused the government of having \"serious questions to answer\" as \"now it appears that the figure is half of what Keir Starmer promised to Parliament yesterday\". Cartlidge said Labour needs \"to be straight about the facts\", adding: \"We need transparency on these critical matters of national security.\" Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

        "content": "An artist who has created a sculpture using the door of a bombed home in Ukraine is appealing for places display it. Robert Marshall from Wareham, Dorset, salvaged the door, which is covered in scorch marks from the heat of a blast and has a hole blown through it, from Toretsk. The conceptual and environmental sculptor said he chose the door as it represents the \"safety and security\" people have at home, and he wanted to draw attention to the fact that families had lost this during Russia's full-scale invasion. Mr Marshall is looking for venues or outside spaces around the UK to display the sculpture, which has been mounted on a pile of rubble. He said: \"I had the idea to try and get a door three years ago to tell the plight of all the people that are suffering\". Unable to travel to the war zone himself, Mr Marshall got in touch with soldiers in Toretsk, via a Ukranian refugee in Swanage. He said the door was pulled from the rubble of the city home where 30,000 people used to live during a lull in the fighting \"now there is no one left it is a complete bomb site.\" After getting a courier to ship the door, he said when it arrived at his home he decided to leave it just as it is. He said: \"This door just said everything... to do anything to it would detract from its message.\" When it goes on show to the public, Mr Marshall said he planned to add stories of Ukrainian families to the artwork. \"I wish it to be a monument to all the innocent casualties of war. I hope it to be a voice for all the refugees,\" he said. Tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians have died since Russia launched its full-scale invasion three years ago, while large swathes of Ukraine have been destroyed.

        "summary": "Donald Trump says the deal would give Ukraine \"the right to fight on\" in its war with Russia.",
        "content": "Ukraine has agreed the terms of a major minerals deal with the US, a senior official in Kyiv has told the BBC. \"We have indeed agreed it with a number of good amendments and see it as a positive outcome,\" the official said, without providing any further details. Media reports say Washington has dropped initial demands for a right to $500bn (£395bn) in potential revenue from utilising the natural resources but has not given firm security guarantees to war-torn Ukraine - a key Ukrainian demand. US President Donald Trump said he was expecting his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington to sign the deal this week, after the two leaders exchanged strong words about each other. Without confirming that an agreement had been reached, Trump said on Tuesday that in return for the deal Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\". \"They're very brave,\" he told reporters, but \"without the United States and its money and its military equipment, this war would have been over in a very short period of time\". Asked whether supplies of US equipment and ammunition to Ukraine would continue, he said: \"Maybe until we have a deal with Russia... We need to have a deal, otherwise it's going to continue.\" There would be a need for \"some form of peacekeeping\" in Ukraine following any peace deal, Trump added, but that would need to be \"acceptable to everyone\". Ukraine holds deposits of critical elements and minerals, including lithium and titanium, as well as sizeable coal, gas, oil and uranium deposits - supplies worth billions of dollars. Trump claims this deal would see the US receive more than it had spent on Ukraine, but more details reportedly need to be ironed out. According to a Ukrainian government source, what has been agreed at this stage are the initial terms of an agreement that includes the country's critical minerals and other resources. \"The provisions of the deal are much better for Ukraine now,\" they added. Reports suggest it would see the creating of a jointly owned fund, which would be used to rebuild Ukraine's infrastructure and economy. Ukraine would contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to the fund - and the fund would then invest in projects in Ukraine itself. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna, who has been leading negotiations, told the Financial Times that the deal was \"part of a bigger picture\". Against a hostile backdrop where Washington appears to be aligning with Moscow, it is hoped this agreement will pave the way for more co-operation between Kyiv and its once biggest ally. Just last week, Trump described Zelensky as a \"dictator\", and appeared to blame Ukraine - not Russia - for starting the war, after the Ukrainian leader rejected US demands for $500bn in mineral wealth and suggested that the American president was living in a \"disinformation space\" created by Russia. Zelensky argued nowhere near that much American aid had been provided, adding: \"I can't sell our state.\" On Tuesday, Trump said the US had given Ukraine between $300bn and $350bn. \"We want to get that money back,\" he said. \"We're helping the country through a very very big problem...  but the American taxpayer now is going to get their money back plus.\" Trump said he had heard that Zelensky would come to Washington DC on Friday to sign the deal. Kyiv hopes that a financial stake might give the White House a reason to protect Ukraine if this war was to reignite after a ceasefire was signed. The White House meanwhile is setting a precedent. US aid in the Trump era comes with strings attached. Aid for aid's sake – whether given for humanitarian or strategic reasons – is a thing of the past. That represents a fundamental reordering of American foreign policy for more than 75 years, from the days of the Marshall Plan to post-Cold War idealism and George W Bush's \"Freedom Agenda\" push to promote global democracy. Ukraine is just the start. Expect Trump and his foreign policy team to apply their \"America First\" principles around the world over the course of the next four years. Zelensky raised the prospect of access to some of the country's mineral wealth last year, when he presented a \"victory plan\" to Western partners. On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was open to offering the US access to rare minerals, including from Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine, and asserted that his country had \"significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine\". Ukraine and its European allies have become increasingly alarmed over a recent thaw in US-Russian ties, including their bilateral talks in Saudi Arabia last week. There is concern in Kyiv and across Europe that they might be excluded from any negotiations aimed at ending the war, and that the continent's future security as a whole could be decided behind their backs.  It is estimated that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine - including: Before Russia's full-scale invasion began three years ago, Ukraine also produced  7% of the world's titanium, used in construction for everything from aeroplanes to power stations. Ukrainian land also contains significant deposits of rare earth metals, a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world Some mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn remain in Russian-occupied territories today. A minister says nearly all key details have been finalised for a deal giving the US access to the country's minerals. The statue commemorates Colonel Robert A Smith, a Scot who was struck down in Kentucky during the US civil war. The Liberal Party of Canada will soon choose a leader that will replace Justin Trudeau and become Canada's next prime minister. \"They'll be extended an invitation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"They deserve to be down here.\" The petition accuses Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty, but has no legal force.

        "content": "Liverpool manager Arne Slot has been given a two-game touchline ban by the Football Association following his red card against Everton. He was dismissed for approaching referee Michael Oliver on the pitch after the 2-2 Premier League draw at Goodison Park on 12 February. Slot will miss Wednesday's home game with Newcastle and the visit of Southampton on 8 March. He can be on the touchline for the Champions League last-16 first-leg tie with Paris St-Germain on 5 March. Slot was also fined £70,000 after accepting the charge. Liverpool assistant coach Sipke Hulshoff was banned for two games and fined £7,000, while Liverpool and Everton were fined £65,000 and £50,000 respectively for failing to control their players. James Tarkowski's 98th-minute equaliser sparked chaotic scenes, with Everton fans entering the field to celebrate. Liverpool thought Tarkowski's goal, which was checked by the video assistant referee (VAR), should have been ruled out for a push on defender Ibrahima Konate in the build-up. Slot exchanged words with one of the assistant referees before shaking hands with Oliver, who immediately showed him a red card. Hulshoff was also sent off. Slot, who was unable to speak to the media after the match because of his red card, later voiced his frustration over the amount of stoppage time played, after five minutes were initially signalled.

        "author": "Simon Atkinson",
        "published_date": "3 hours ago",
        "summary": "Marty Sheargold said that the Matildas players reminded him of \"year 10 girls\".",
        "content": "An Australian radio presenter has left the network after comments he made about the country's women's football team – which have been branded as misogynist and disrespectful. Marty Sheargold had said on nationwide radio station Triple M that the Matildas players reminded him of \"year 10 girls\" and implies that their matches were boring. He apologised earlier on Wednesday, and was due to be back on air but did not appear in his usual time slot. Southern Cross Austereo (SCA), the parent company of Triple M, later said Sheargold and the station had agreed to \"mutually part ways\". In a statement on Wednesday, Sheargold said that he fully understood the gravity of his remarks and would like to \"sincerely apologise to the Matildas and the broader organisation\". The company said that it \"takes its responsibility to listeners, shareholders, and clients seriously and its programming should align with the standards and expectations of its audience.\" \"Right now, it's clear this is a moment for reflection and review. Triple M, and the wider SCA network, will continue to take all necessary steps to support staff,\" the firm's chief content officer Dave Cameron said in a statement. Earlier the sport's governing body said the remarks \"diminish the extraordinary achievements\" of a team that were semi-finalists in the women's world cup in 2023. During his drivetime show on Monday afternoon, Sheargold interjected during a sports bulletin - which was discussing Australia's defeat to the US in its second consecutive loss in the SheBelieves Cup. \"You know what they remind me of? Year 10 girls,\" Sheargold said, to the laughter of his co-hosts. \"All the infighting and all the friendship issues... Now I'm sorry to undermine the whole sport, but that's what I think of it.\" When his colleague mentioned the SheBelieves Cup by name, Sheargold interrupted saying: \"Oh, she believes in what? It better be men.\" And when reference was made to Australia hosting the AFC Women's Asian Cup next year, he said \"oh god - the Asian Cup\", before criticising the event with an obscene comment. He then asked his co-host: \"Got any men's sport?\" Sheargold's comments later went viral. Minister for Sport Anika Wells called the comments \"boorish, boring and wrong\". \"Australia's most watched television event ever was the Matildas World Cup semi-final; the Tillies' quarterfinal is the second-most-watched event in Australian history,\" Ms Wells said. Australian Olympian Ambrosia Malone, who represents her country in hockey, also criticised Sheargold. \"All I could think about was the young girls sitting in the car with their parents, maybe on the way to or from their own training sessions hearing this,\" she wrote on social media. \"I'm sure many of them would have been hurt and confused… I was in disbelief. \"This is apparently acceptable on mainstream afternoon radio??? HOW??\" Football Australia said it was \"deeply disappointed by the unacceptable comments\" which \"fail to recognise the profound impact they have had on Australian sport and society\". \"This incident is a stark reminder of the responsibility media outlets and personalities have in fostering respectful and constructive discussions about women's sport and its participants,\" it added.

        "headline": "Tesla shares slump after European sales fall",
        "author": "Tom Espiner",
        "published_date": "3 hours ago",
        "summary": "Shares in the US electric carmaker dropped after European sales halved in January.",
        "content": "Shares in electric car maker Tesla have slumped more than 9% after EU and UK sales fell by almost half in January. The drop in Tesla shares took the company's valuation back below $1trn for the first time since November 2024. Tesla has been facing stiff competition in the European market from Chinese and other manufacturers. In addition, Tesla owner Elon Musk has been making controversial political waves on both sides of the Atlantic, an analyst said. Tesla sales in January bucked European electric car sale trends, which grew by more than a third in the month, according to trade body Acea. Instead, Tesla sales across the EU, EFTA and the UK fell more than 45%, and more than 50% in the EU alone. It comes after Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade as demand faltered and rivals gained pace. The main factor in the January sales slump was likely to be increasing competition, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said. Chinese manufacturer BYD has been making big strides, in part because it includes as standard some features which cost extra from other makers, Mould said. However, some car buyers may also be taking a \"principled stand\" on Musk's political interventions, he said. Musk has made waves in the US with his involvement in slashing US development funds and efforts to drastically reduce US federal funding. In the UK he supports jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, and repeatedly criticised Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. Musk also supports the far-right AfD party in Germany, and congratulated its leader after the party's record second-place result in elections. Asked if the reason for Tesla's share price slump was down to Musk being too toxic, a former senior director of the car maker's Europe, Middle East and Asia division said it was \"definitely one of the reasons for the decline\", but added there was a \"cumulative number of things that are piling up a domino effect\". \"There's no doubt his flirting with the right in politics, running around on TV with a chainsaw is not exactly helping his image,\" Peter Bardenfleth-Hansen told the BBC's Today programme. \"He may be getting a bigger fanbase within a specific type of clientele, but they're not the ones that are buying the Teslas. They're not the ones putting money in to his company. So he has a problem.\" Tesla shares got a big boost after the US election due to Musk's closeness to Donald Trump - Musk has described himself as \"first buddy\" to the US president. Investors thought this would stand his businesses in good stead. However, Trump is not a supporter of electric vehicles, and has said he will cancel efforts to boost their ownership. \"How anybody thought this was going to be good for Tesla, I don't know,\" Mould said. There is also general market skittishness about the path of interest rate cuts and concerns about Trump tariff plans that could be contributing to the fall, he added. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "author": "Kayla Epstein",
        "published_date": "13 hours ago",
        "summary": "The agency known as \"Doge\" is Musk's brainchild, but the White House insists that he is not its leader - or even employed by it.",
        "content": "On Monday afternoon, a federal judge had a simple question for the Trump administration's lawyers: Is tech billionaire Elon Musk the Department of Government Efficiency's administrator? The agency more popularly known as \"Doge\" is Musk's brainchild, but the White House insists that he is not its leader - or even employed by it. Justice department lawyer Bradley Humphreys told the judge that: \"I don't have any information beyond he's a close adviser to the president.\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt doubled down on this position at a Tuesday press briefing. \"The president tasked Elon Musk to oversee the Doge effort,\" she said, but she later added that \"career officials\" and appointees were helping Musk run Doge, and that people who have \"onboarded\" as federal employees were working at various agencies. She declined to provide specific names, but she announced that Musk would attend President Donald Trump's first cabinet secretary meeting alongside the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General and other top US political appointees who were vetted and confirmed by the Senate. The White House later told the BBC that a person named Amy Gleason is the acting administrator. They did not provide additional details about her or when she was appointed. Ms Gleason declined to comment, CBS News reported. Musk has been leading an outside effort to aggressively curtail government spending through funding cuts and firings. \"They're playing a game,\" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the non-partisan Partnership for Public Service, an organisation that has provided past administrations with procedure and ethics guidance. \"If [Musk] were actually the administrator, then this issue about him needing Senate confirmation and his actually having to abide by the conflict of interest laws would be much clearer.\" Experts said that Musk has given the impression of being in charge of Doge by staffing the government entity with employees and engineers from his various companies, posting constantly about its work on X, appearing alongside Trump in the Oval Office to promote the cuts it has made to the federal workforce, and representing it on stage at the Conservative Political Action Committee gathering last week while wielding a chainsaw. \"We're in Alice in Wonderland right now,\" Mr Stier said. \"We're through the looking glass.\" Trump established Doge by renaming the United States Digital Service - an agency focused on digital and web infrastructure - to the United States Doge Service via an executive order. The order establishes Doge's leadership structure, saying that \"there shall be a USDS Administrator\" that reports up to the White House chief of staff. It does not name a specific individual for the role. In fact, Musk's name never appears in the executive order, though Trump has credited his work with the team. Doge's arrival has caused turbulence in the existing US Digital Service ranks. The administration fired several staffers there earlier this month, and the Associated Press reported that 21 employees resigned in protest on Tuesday. In a letter to management, they alleged Doge employees were creating \"significant security risks\". \"We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,\" their letter stated, according to the AP. \"However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.\" BBC News has reviewed the letter but has not been able to verify its contents. A series of lawsuits challenging Doge have slowed some of the administration's effort to cut the federal workforce, and they have forced the Trump White House to face the question of Musk's status in court. Until the  administration stated that Ms Gleason was the acting administrator late on Tuesday, it gave vague answers about Doge's leadership across multiple lawsuits. Though she did not rule in the hearing on Monday, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly expressed concern about Doge's constitutionality. She noted it might run afoul of the appointment clause of the US Constitution, which sets out nominating procedures for agency leaders. \"It does seem to me if you have people that are not authorised to carry out some of these functions that they're carrying out that does raise an issue,\" she said. \"I would hope that by now we would know who is the administrator, who is the acting administrator and what authority do they have?\" Experts say that Musk's work does not fit the traditional definition of \"special government employee\", which has specific rules. The White House has previously said that Musk \"is a special government employee and has abided by all applicable federal laws\". William Resh, a professor who studies the executive branch at the University of Southern California, said typically such employees have been hired as advisers for their relative expertise. \"But they do not hold distinct executive power the way that a Senate-confirmed appointee would, or even a unilateral permanent appointments that a president can make,\" he said. While Musk appears to have made several moves regarding the federal workforce largely unencumbered, his recent demand that federal employees list five accomplishments in an email was met with pushback from some Trump-appointed agency leaders. The directive was walked back as optional at some agencies, over concerns staff could reveal sensitive information and that the order violated federal policies. Asked whether this showed tension between Doge and Trump's other officials, Leavitt insisted that \"everyone is working together as one unified team at the direction of President Trump\".

        "headline": "Apple boss says its DEI programmes may change",
        "author": "Natalie Sherman",
        "published_date": "17 hours ago",
        "summary": "His comments came as shareholders rejected a call for the firm to consider ending its diversity practices. ",
        "content": "Apple boss Tim Cook has said his company may have to change its diversity practices as the US legal landscape shifts. His comments came just minutes after a majority of shareholders rejected a proposal calling on the tech giant to consider ending its diversity policies, such as the use of race and sex in hiring decisions. Apple had urged shareholders to vote against the measure, which the company had argued was  \"inappropriately\" trying \"to micromanage\" its business. The scrutiny of the firm comes as US President Donald Trump has called for an end to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the government and private sector. Trump's orders have run into legal roadblocks, but many companies in the US, including big names such as Meta, Amazon and Goldman Sachs, have already ended or rolled back their own policies, citing legal risks. Apple's decision to fight the shareholder proposal had bucked that tide. Shareholder measures opposed by companies rarely succeed, so the outcome of Tuesday's vote was expected. It marked the second high-profile defeat of shareholder proposal targeting DEI, after a similar rejection at retailer Costco. However, despite the vote, Mr Cook on Tuesday acknowledged that the firm may have to alter some of its practices. \"As the legal landscape around this issue evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply, but our north star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will never waver,\" Mr Cook said during a question-and-answer session at the company's annual shareholder meeting. He noted that Apple did not use \"quotas\" for hiring - a practice that has come in for some of the fiercest criticism - while saying the firm's strength came from a culture where \"people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives come together\". \"We'll continue to work together to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\" he added, saying the company would remain \"committed to the values that have always made us who we are\". The proposal targeting Apple's DEI policies was backed by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, which had also put forward the proposal at Costco. It argued that the existence of Apple's diversity and inclusion programmes exposed the firm to \"litigation, reputational and financial risks\", pointing to the wider corporate retreat and noting that recent lawsuits have made it easier for workers to sue over discrimination. Stefan Padfield of the organisation's Free Enterprise Project, who presented the proposal at Tuesday's meeting, said the risks to Apple had increased after the Trump administration recently ordered staff to investigate DEI in the private sector. \"The vibe shift is clear,\" he said. \"DEI is out and merit is in.\" Apple's decision to push back against the shareholder proposal, while simultaneously opening the door to changing its policy is likely to satisfy both sides of the fight, said Angela Jackson, a senior advisor to the Project on Workforce at Harvard University and author of the forthcoming book, The Win-Win Workplace. But she warned that it left Apple \"playing defence\". She said she wanted to see the company lead by making a more robust business case for the programmes. \"They've made the right moves. The one step they could go further... is to really say, 'Yes it's our values, we believe it's the right thing to do, but it's also an economic imperative.\" The fight over DEI in the US has raised questions about whether such policies in other countries will face similar challenges. Catherine Howarth, chief executive of the responsible investment charity ShareAction, said she thought that Apple - a global, consumer-facing firm - had made the bet that the benefits of pushing back against the shareholder proposal outweighed the risks. \"It's not popular with consumers and it's not popular with employees to abandon what were supposedly your principles in this area until very recently,\" she said. \"They think it would go down very badly - and it would - with their global consumer base.\" Shareholders also rejected proposals that would have required Apple to report about its AI privacy practices, charitable giving and policies to combat child sex abuse. They backed the board members supported by the company, as well as its executive compensation, including a pay package for Mr Cook worth more than $74m. The tech giant's decision has prompted questions and concerns about reduced protections for UK iCloud users. The iPhone giant's $500bn investment plan includes a new factory in Texas, as well as money spent on suppliers. Customers' photos and documents stored online will no longer be protected by end-to-end encryption. Apple is hoping its latest, lower cost iPhone model will boost sales of its flagship device. The Home Office served the notice to the tech giant under the Investigatory Powers Act. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "headline": "Trump orders copper probe in first step to tariffs",
        "author": "Natalie Sherman",
        "published_date": "13 hours ago",
        "summary": "The White House said the metal was vital to national security.\n",
        "content": "US President Donald Trump has ordered an investigation of copper imports in what is a first step toward potential tariffs on the metal. Administration officials said the White House wanted to find ways to boost US production of copper, a component used to make electric cars, ships and data centres that they said was vital to national security. The move launches a process that Trump previously used to put tariffs on steel and aluminium, opening a new front in his trade war. Trump has already raised tariffs on goods from China, while threatening a range of more sweeping trade actions, including a 25% border tax on goods from Canada and Mexico and new \"reciprocal\" tariffs set for each country. The trade fights have drawn threats of retaliation, while raising alarm among consumers and businesses in the US about higher costs. Concerns about the plans have contributed to a sharp drop in consumer confidence on recent surveys. But administration officials said on Tuesday they believed this action was necessary to protect US copper companies from competition from China. \"China has long used industrial capacity and dumping as an economic weapon to dominate global markets, systematically undercutting competitors and driving rivals out of business,\" Peter Navarro said. \"It's time for copper to come home,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said. Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries, which are paid by the company that is bringing in the goods. They are intended to support domestic production by making imports more expensive. The US is already a major copper producer, while also importing the metal mainly from Chile, Canada and Mexico. China's global copper exports rose last year, as domestic demand weakened, and authorities raced to curb production. The so-called 232 investigation by the Commerce Department will look at copper imports, as well as imports of copper \"derivatives\". The timeline of the probe was not clear. On a background briefing about the action, a White House official said the results of the investigation would inform the level of possible tariffs. The BBC's Analysis Editor Ros Atkins looks at why the US wants access to Ukraine's minerals. Ireland has a goods-trade surplus with the US of just over €50bn (£41.6bn), according to new data. The surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate tariffs prompts questions over the possible impact on British businesses.

        "content": "Rorschach tests play with the human imagination and our mind's ability to impart meaning onto the world around us – but what does AI see in them? For more than a century, the Rorschach inkblot test has been widely used as a window into people's personality. Even if you haven't done one yourself, you'll recognise the mirrored ink smudges that form ambiguous shapes on cards. Developed by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach in 1921, the test involves showing a number of inkblots to subjects, then asking them to say what they see. The images are deliberately inscrutable and open to interpretation. For decades they were popular among psychologists as a way of understanding a person's psyche from the creatures, objects or scenes they perceive in the shapes. It relies upon a phenomenon known as pareidolia, which is a tendency to find meaningful interpretations in things where there is none. It is the same reason why people see faces or animals in cloud formations or on the surface of the Moon. You might see a butterfly in the image while someone else might see a skull. According to proponents of the test, both interpretations shed light on how you think. While many psychologists today believe the test is now obsolete and has little credibility as a psychometric tool, it is still used in some parts of the world and is even used as part of courtroom evidence, although this is controversial. Rorschach never intended it to be a measure of personality, but rather a way of identifying disordered thinking in patients, such as those with schizophrenia. Some psychologists, however, still believe it is useful as a tool in therapy as a way of encouraging self-reflection or starting conversations. \"When a person interprets a Rorschach image, they unconsciously project elements of their psyche such as fears, desires, and cognitive biases,\" says Barbara Santini, a London-based psychologist, who uses the Rorschach test with her clients. \"The test works because human vision isn't passive, but a meaning-making process shaped by personal experience.\" Finding meaning or familiar shapes in inkblots relies upon a number of cognitive processes that humans use every day, including memory, emotion and the ability to deal with ambiguity. But what happens if you have no personal experience, or you offer it to a \"brain\" that works in an entirely different way? What might an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm recognise in these inkblots? And what would their answers tell us about the human mind? Recent developments in the capabilities of AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT means it's now possible to put that to the test. So-called \"multimodal models\" can accept image-based inputs and provide responses as easily as they are to interact with text-based prompts thanks to their machine vision capabilities. We gave ChatGPT five of the 10 common images used in an inkblot test to see how it would interpret the images. But the AI system's training data – information that helps establish its \"knowledge\", makes it trickier to do so. AI v the Mind This article is part of AI v the Mind, a series that aims to explore the limits of cutting-edge AI and learn a little about how our own brains work along the way. With some expert help, each article pits different AI tools against the human mind, asking probing questions designed to test the limits of intelligence. Can a machine write a better joke than a professional comedian, or unpick a moral conundrum more elegantly than a philosopher? We hope to find out. Showing the AI model the first inkblot card from an online database of inkblots, which is commonly interpreted by humans as a bat, butterfly or moth, highlighted just how literal AI vision algorithms can be. \"This image is a Rorschach inkblot, often used in psychological assessments to explore perception and interpretation,\" the chatbot replied. \"It is designed to be ambiguous so that each person might see something different depending on their experiences, emotions, and imagination.\" Pretence spoiled, it then went on to explain what it saw in the same answer, without me having to prompt it further. \"For me, it resembles something symmetrical, possibly two animals or figures facing each other, or a single entity with wings outstretched,\" the chatbot responded. \"The beauty of these inkblots is that they invite individual interpretations!\" The chatbot then asked me back what I saw in the image – a question I chose to ignore, instead pressing it to see which of the two resemblances it had suggested it thought was most fitting. \"Looking closely, I'd say it most resembles a single entity with wings outstretched – perhaps a bat or a moth, with its wings open symmetrically,\" the chatbot wrote. \"The central area could be interpreted as the body, and the details on the sides evoke the texture or shape of wings.\" \"I think that's just rehearsing what it knows of the specific test,\" says Coen Dekker, a Dutch software developer who a decade ago asked a neural network, an early version of the technology underpinning AI chatbots today, to complete a Rorschach test. (Dekker's experiment was significantly more simplified because of the technical constraints of the neural networks of the time.) \"I believe it mainly identifies patterns, shapes, and textures within the blots, and then compares these features to a vast dataset of human responses to generate its interpretation of what it sees in the inkblots,\" says Ieva Kubiliute, a London-based psychologist. \"ChatGPT provides interesting, human-like responses, but it is likely not genuinely thinking – instead, it appears to be scanning an online dataset,\" says Chandril Ghosh, lecturer in psychology at the University of Kent, in the UK, specialising in mental health, AI and treatment. It's similar to the way a musician who has never experienced heartbreak can still write a song that pulls at your heartstrings, simply by analysing how other similar songs like it are structured. Or as Santini, the psychologist puts it, \"If an AI's response resembles a human's, it's not because it sees the same thing but it's because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture.\" What we get is a facsimile of reality – and of thought. \"ChatGPT can accurately describe emotions without actually experiencing them,\" Ghosh says. That doesn't make AI useless when it comes to matters of the mind, however. \"ChatGPT can understand emotions, describe them, and help others make sense of their feelings,\" he says. Ghosh believes that ChatGPT is simply regurgitating random information from its dataset for the benefit of users – which gives the impression of \"thinking\", but never actually is. Part of the reason why we perceive it possibly as thinking is the way that the tech companies behind these AI chatbots present their products. ChatGPT and tools like it are always helpful, always conscientious, and always conversational. The anthropomorphising of these tools has helped their adoption – but it can muddy the waters around how they – and their outputs – are perceived. One way of uncovering that unreality is by simply pressing the refresh button, says Ghosh. Present ChatGPT with the same inkblot image to analyse, and it may well come up with a totally different interpretation in the same conversation. When we gave ChatGPT the same image twice, the AI did indeed give different responses. \"A human would typically stick to their previous answer because personal experiences and emotions influence their responses,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, ChatGPT generates responses based on its dataset.\" That's part of the problem when trying to infer meaning in what ChatGPT says about the inkblots it sees: the chatbot is simply regurgitating what its training data has encountered. This is perhaps best demonstrated by an experiment by researchers at the MediaLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US. They trained an AI algorithm called \"Norman\" – named after Alfred Hitchcock's character Norman Bates – on images from a Reddit group that shares images of people dying in gruesome circumstances. When they showed Norman a set of Rorschach inkblots, the images it described seeing reflected the darkness it had been trained upon. While an algorithm trained on a more normal set of image data would see a group of birds on a tree branch, Norman described seeing a man being electrocuted. It is a stark illustration of just how important the data used to train an AI can be. Train a model using bad data, and the resulting AI will reflect the flaws in that data. But what an AI chooses to regurgitate in response to ambiguous stimuli is interesting, says Dekker – in part because of what it says, rather than what it \"knows\" (AI systems know nothing innately). \"It has a general understanding of colour theory and what emotional responses these could give when analysed,\" says Dekker. \"I have a feeling it has a general understanding of the images and what people associate it with. This got me thinking: Wouldn't it be cool if we had – or created – a new set of Rorschach-like images which the model does not know about at all, and let it analyse those?\" While this isn't something Dekker is actively pursuing, we know that AI algorithms do have a tendency to \"hallucinate\" and invent information that isn't true. But it is also possible force them to hallucinate too. In one experiment by computer scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US, they were able to 3D print a turtle with a particular colour and texture that fooled a machine vision system into thinking it was a rifle. Similarly, a few stickers on a stop sign can render it invisible to the algorithm – a potential risk for a self-driving car. (Read more about the 'weird events' that make machines hallucinate.) AI algorithms are particularly good at spotting patterns, but those differing responses to a single ambiguous image also highlight an aspect of the human mind that AI can't replicate: the emotions and unconscious meanings we attach to things we encounter in the world around us. There was no subjectivity in what the AI system was saying when presented with the inkblots, Kubiliute says. \"It cannot understand the symbolic meaning or emotional resonance that a human might associate with a particular image.\" And that in itself tells us a lot about the human mind. \"The human psyche is filled with internal conflicts, such as the tension between desires and morals or fears and ambitions,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, AI functions on clear logic and does not struggle with inner dilemmas essential to human thought and decision-making.\" -- For more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "Singapore's biggest bank, DBS, says it expects to cut about 4,000 roles over the next three years as artificial intelligence (AI) takes on more work currently done by humans. The move will affect temporary and contract staff, a bank spokesperson said, with the reduction in the workforce coming from \"natural attrition\" as projects are completed. Permanent staff are not affected by the cuts. The bank's outgoing chief executive Piyush Gupta also said it expected to create around 1,000 new AI-related jobs. It makes DBS one of the first major banks to offer details on how AI will affect its operations. The company did not say how many jobs would be cut in Singapore. \"Over the next three years, we envisage that AI could reduce the need to renew about 4,000 temporary/contract staff across our 19 markets working on specific projects,\" the DBS spokesperson said. \"As such, we expect the reduction in workforce will come from natural attrition as these temporary and contract roles are completed over the next few years.\" DBS currently has between 8,000 and 9,000 temporary and contract workers. The bank employs a total of around 41,000 people. Last year, Mr Gupta said DBS had been working on AI for over a decade. \"We today deploy over 800 AI models across 350 use cases, and expect the measured economic impact of these to exceed S$1bn ($745m; £592m) in 2025,\" he added. Mr Gupta is set to leave the firm at the end of March. Current deputy chief executive Tan Su Shan will replace him. The ongoing proliferation of AI technology has put its benefits and risks under the spotlight, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) saying in 2024 that it is set to affect nearly 40% of all jobs worldwide. The IMF's managing director Kristalina Georgieva said that \"in most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality\". The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, told the BBC last year that AI will not be a \"mass destroyer of jobs\" and human workers will learn to work with new technologies. Mr Bailey said that while there are risks with AI, \"there is great potential with it\". The funding will also support research into quantum biology and improving conversation efforts.

        "summary": "The iPhone giant's $500bn investment plan includes a new factory in Texas, as well as money spent on suppliers. ",
        "content": "Apple plans to invest more than $500bn (£396bn) in the US over the next four years, starting with a new advanced manufacturing factory in Texas. The tech giant said it expected to create 20,000 new jobs over that time, with the \"vast majority\" of roles in research and development, software and artificial intelligence (AI). It is not clear to what extent the spending is an acceleration of the company's current activities. Apple said the sum included everything from spending on suppliers to Apple TV+ productions. The announcement comes days after Apple boss Tim Cook met with President Donald Trump, who has made increased corporate investment in the US a priority. In its announcement, Apple said its investment was its \"largest-ever spend commitment\" and would expand its support for American manufacturing. \"We are bullish on the future of American innovation,\" Cook said. The new 250,000 sq ft factory in Houston, Texas, is set to produce servers that were \"previously manufactured outside the US\" to support Apple Intelligence, the company's AI system, the company said. The iPhone maker added it would open in 2026 and create thousands of jobs. Apple is also expanding its data centre capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona and Nevada, and doubling its support for a fund dedicated to US manufacturing, which it created in Trump's first term, from $5bn to $10bn. Trump previewed the announcement last week, claiming it was partially a response to his trade policies, including tariffs. On Monday, the president took credit for the news on social media, saying the reason for the investment was \"faith in what we are doing, without which, they wouldn't be investing ten cents\". Trump has said he wants to see more companies making their products in the US, threatening to raise tariffs drastically in a bid to make domestic manufacturing more attractive. Last month, he imposed a new 10% border tax on all imports from China, where Apple has a significant manufacturing presence. He has also proposed tariffs on products made in many other countries, including neighbouring nations Mexico and Canada. Eileen Burbidge, a venture capital investor in tech businesses and a founding partner of Passion Capital, said Apple had made similar announcements before. In 2018 the company announced a $350bn investment in the US, and in 2021 it said it was committing $430bn to its home market, both times saying the investments would add 20,000 jobs over five years. \"It's starting to become a bit business as usual,\" she told the BBC. \"But obviously it's music to Donald Trump's ears.\" Investing in its own research and development (R&D) was in the company's best interests, she said, although the US investment was \"relatively small\" compared to what it spends on R&D globally. \"[But] bringing some of that back to the US - again that's a really smart political move to make these large announcements in order to demonstrate commitment to US industry.\" General Sir David Richards said the decision \"almost certainly would not\" be happening if not for Trump. Donald Trump says the deal would give Ukraine \"the right to fight on\" in its war with Russia. The tech giant's decision has prompted questions and concerns about reduced protections for UK iCloud users. The funding will also support research into quantum biology and improving conversation efforts.

        "published_date": "2 hours ago",
        "summary": "The 17-year-old had an additional set of limbs, buttocks and genitals that protruded from his abdomen.",
        "content": "Doctors in the Indian capital, Delhi, have performed a life-changing surgery on a 17-year-old boy to remove his \"parasitic\" twin that was attached to his abdomen. A parasitic twin is an underdeveloped conjoined twin that relies entirely on the host twin for survival. They are extremely rare, with less than one case occurring per 100,000 births. The teenager who had a fully developed extra set of limbs and a pelvis - sustained by a chest artery - underwent a two-hour surgery at Aiims hospital in Delhi. Dr Asuri Krishna, who led the team of specialists, said the surgery was particularly challenging because of the patient's age. \"Only 40-50 cases of parasitic twins have been documented in world medical literature and, in those cases, the surgery had been attempted on children,\" Dr Krishna told the BBC. With insufficient medical literature to guide them, the team had to rely on their \"intuition, skill and knowledge\", he added. Parasitic twins form when one foetus partially develops while attached to the other. In this case, the teenager had two fully formed legs, buttocks and external genitalia - weighing nearly 15kg - protruding from his abdomen. Remarkably, the parasitic limbs could feel pain, touch and change in temperature. Dr Krishna said the first thing they did was identify how interconnected the parasitic and host twins were. Through scans, the doctors found out that the parasitic twin was attached to the teen's breastbone and was being supplied blood from a vessel in his chest. \"But there wasn't much connection with other main organs like the liver or kidneys,\" Dr Krishna said, adding that they also found a large cyst in the teen's abdomen. The surgery was done in two stages - first, removing the parasitic twin, then extracting the cystic mass from surrounding organs. A team of doctors, including radiologists, anaesthetists and plastic surgeons, completed the procedure in two-and-a-half hours. \"A mesh of shared blood vessels, nerves and tissues had to be separated. Care had to be taken to see that none of the host's organs or tissues were damaged,\" Dr Krishna said. During surgery, the teen's blood pressure dropped dangerously as 30-40% of his blood flowed to the parasitic twin. But the doctors said they were prepared for it and swiftly stabilised him. The teen was discharged four days after being admitted. He is healthy and has suffered no complications from the surgery, Dr Krishna says. The teenager's unusual appearance made him the subject of gossip and ridicule in his neighbourhood in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh. The stares and jokes took a toll on his mental health, leaving him feeling isolated and lonely. \"I couldn't travel anywhere or do any physical activity,\" he told the Indian Express newspaper, adding that he had dropped out of school in the eighth grade. The 17-year-old told the Express that he was ecstatic and now wanted to live an active life. \"I hope to study and get a job. A new world has opened up to me,\" he said. India's population is 1.4 billion but its consuming class is only 140 million, or about as big as Mexico.

        "content": "A Sydney nurse who was suspended over a video in which she allegedly made  threats against Israeli patients has been charged by police. Sarah Abu Lebdeh, 26, is facing three charges: threatening violence to a group, using a carriage service to threaten to kill, and using a carriage service to harass or cause offence. Ms Abu Lebdeh and another man were both suspended from their duties at Bankstown Hospital after the video - filmed on an anonymous online platform which pairs people randomly for a chat - was released online. Authorities say there is \"no evidence\" the pair actually harmed patients. In the footage, which appeared to have been filmed inside a hospital and was published by an Israeli content creator, Ms Abu Lebdeh and Ahmad Rashad Nadir allegedly bragged about refusing to treat Israeli patients, killing them, and said they would go to hell. The video spread widely online and caused public outcry, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese describing it as \"disgusting\" and \"vile\". New South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb said the charges are a significant breakthrough in what has been a complicated investigation as it involves an overseas witness. \"Detectives must be commended for acting swiftly under enormous pressure and public expectation,\" she said. Ms Abu Lebdeh was granted bail - although she is banned from social media and from leaving the country - and will return to court on 19 March. Mr Nadir is receiving medical treatment and has not been charged but is still under investigation, NSW Police said.

        "published_date": "1 day ago",
        "summary": "Synaesthesia is a neurological condition found to enhance memory and learning. Now, scientists say seeing in colour could help when it comes to learning a second language.",
        "content": "Synaesthesia is a neurological condition found to enhance memory and learning. Now, scientists say seeing in colour could help when it comes to learning a second language. My mother's name is the colour of milk. The strings of an acoustic guitar, when strummed, play the warm yellow of honeycomb. The sound is flat, hard and smooth. And Monday is pink. These sensations are always the same, and always present. This is synaesthesia – in my case grapheme-colour synaesthesia, sound-colour synaesthesia and sound-texture synaesthesia. Like many synaesthetes, I discovered at a young age I had a flair for both music and languages. In music, it wasn't the physical act of performing I excelled at, but composition. I went on to become a composer for short films and dance theatre, and a sound editor for television. Writing music felt a lot like a language to me, as I \"saw\" the colours of the sounds in a similar way. I also studied French, German, Spanish and linguistics – the colour of language helping me to remember words as well as the patterns of grammar. Synaesthesia is a neurological phenomenon that causes an estimated 4.4% of people to experience the world as a cacophony of sensations. Around 60 different types of synaesthesia have been identified, but there could be more than 100, with some types experienced in clusters. The condition is thought to be caused by genetically inherited traits that affect the structural and functional development of the brain. Increased communication between sensory regions in the brain means, for example, words can stimulate taste, sequences of numbers may be perceived in spatial arrangements, or the feel of textures might conjure emotions. Synaesthesia is not considered to be a neurological disorder and – although it has been linked to neurodevelopmental and mental health conditions including autism, anxiety and schizophrenia – it is described as an \"alternative perceptual reality\" and generally thought to be beneficial. \"When I was younger I knew I saw the world in a different way, and my way of describing that to others was 'colourful',\" says Smadar Frisch. Frisch, who has grapheme-colour synaesthesia, sound-colour synaesthesia and lexical–gustatory synaesthesia – where words have taste – explores the world of senses through her podcast, Chromatic Minds, and is currently writing her first book on the subject. \"Learning in school was too much for me sensory-wise,\" she says. \"It is very difficult trying to solve an equation when all the colouring of a series of numbers was a psychedelic blast.\" This explosion of colour, says Frisch, would cause her to lose focus and forget what she was doing. \"[It was the] same with language. The words' colours, music and taste sensations ignited me and I wanted to express myself so much – that I lost focus.\" It wasn't until she'd almost finished high school that she came across Richard Cytowic and David Eagleman's book, Wednesday is Indigo blue. \"My initial thought was that Wednesday is actually orange – and I needed to get this book.\" This was a turning point for Frisch. \"I finally understood how my synaesthete brain is linked and wired. And I thought to myself, this phenomenon is amazing. I can use the colours to help me learn, rather than confuse me.\" Frisch developed a colour coding system to help her learn new languages fluently and quickly. Studying languages no longer felt confusing but \"organised\", she says. \"And it worked! My whole world changed. I went on to learn the thing my brain was meant to excel in: languages.\" Frisch says she was able to learn French and Spanish fluently in just two months. \"I scored 90+ on each [French and Spanish] exam,\" she says. Today Frisch can speak seven languages fluently – and says she can learn any language she wants \"with no difficulty, in a short matter of time\". Julia Simner is director of the Multisense Synaesthesia Research laboratory at the University of Sussex in the UK. She and her team tested around 6,000 children who were six to 10 years old. \"We screened each one individually for synaesthesia, and then gave [them] a battery of tests to determine what skills come with synaesthesia,\" she says. The study found that the children with synaesthesia were better in a number of skills than the children without – skills which, according to Simner, would \"certainly help both first and second language learning\". \"Specifically, they were significantly better in receptive vocabulary (how many words they could understand), productive vocabulary (how many words they knew how to say), short term memory store, attention to detail and creativity,\" Simner says. \"These syn-linked skills predict that we might well expect second-language learning to be easier for someone with synaesthesia.\" Having synaesthetic colours, she says, makes letters more memorable. And the synaesthesia colours can pass from one language into the second language learned, making words in the second language more memorable too. \"The way these colours seep across languages can either be via the way the letter looks or the way the letter sounds,\" says Simner. \"It's like the colour scaffolds across from one language to another.\" In 2019, another experiment led by psychologists at the University of Toronto, Canada, found grapheme-colour synaesthesia, where each letter and number has its own distinct colour, provides a significant advantage in statistical learning – allowing a person to \"see\" patterns – an ability critical to language learning. The researchers asked participants to listen to a set of nonsense words – for example, \"muh-keh\" and \"beh-od\" – representing an artificial \"language\". They then listened to a second set of words. This set included the original artificial words, plus new artificial words which represented a \"foreign\" language. The participants were then asked to distinguish \"words\" from each of the two artificial languages. \"It didn't have meaning,\" says Amy Finn, psychologist and director of the University of Toronto's cognitive neuroscience and developmental laboratory, Finn Land Lab. \"It was constructed to look at 'segmentation' – or how you use regularities to pull out what the segments of language even are. This is a very early but super important problem in early language learning.\" The results showed grapheme-colour synaesthetes were better able to differentiate between the two \"languages\" than participants who didn't have synaesthesia. \"We think [synaesthesia] can help you parse the chunks of language more easily,\" says Finn. When synaesthetes experience the same patterns with more than one sense – for example, both aurally and visually – their mind conjures a bonus secondary cue which can help them recognise or remember the pattern. Take 11-year-old me, put on the spot in my first week of secondary school. \"How do you say 'work'?\" demands my French teacher. The class is silent. I know the word is blue. Then it comes to me. \"Travail,\" I answer. Sometimes I can't remember a word – but I can remember the colour. This can be frustrating because no one can help me if I say \"it's pink\", as the colours are unique to my own mind. On the other hand, colour acts as an extra reminder, a bonus cue I can put to use when learning languages. You might think, then, that synaesthesia would be more prevalent in bilingual children. But research suggests that people who learn a second language later than early childhood are more likely to have this sensory-switching ability than those who are natively bilingual. This bolsters the theory that synaesthesia develops as a learning tool. Synaesthesia emerges in childhood, as a child starts to take in the world around them, and they learn to talk, read and write. A 2016 study by researchers in Canada, the US and the Czech Republic found that children learn to categorise colours between ages of four and seven years, around the time they begin learning to read and write, and synaesthesia then begins to emerge from the age of six. The authors of the study surmise: \"Children use their newly-acquired ability to categorise colour as an unorthodox aid in mastering the domain of letters and words.\" However, synaesthesia can, on occasion, make communication more difficult – and the suggestion that synaesthesia might function as a strategy to facilitate learning \"remains a topic of debate\", says Lucie Bouvet, a psychologist at the University of Toulouse, France. More like this: • How synaesthesia inspires artists • The AI that 'tastes' colours • The adventure of raising bilingual children \"Phoneme-colour synaesthesia [is where] all phonemes – the smallest unit of spoken meaning – evoke the perception of specific colours,\" saysBouvet. This is the experience of a woman identified as 'VA' in a 2023 paper co-authored by Bouvet. For instance, every time VA hears a hard \"a\" sound, she sees luminous cyan. Every time she hears \"k\", she sees red. \"VA describes a way of thinking in images, where words function as a second language,\" says Bouvet. \"The colours evoked by phonemes help her to access meaning.\" VA's process of communication is to hear the sounds, then see the colours, then translate meaning from those colours. This double translation effort could cause VA to lose track of conversations. \"In rare cases, individuals may find their synaesthesia overwhelming, feeling that their internal experiences interfere with their perception of the external world,\" explains Bouvet. Whether helpful or not to the synaesthete, research into synaesthesia can help us to understand cognitive processes of language and perception. \"Synaesthesia is an intriguing phenomenon in itself,\" says Bouvet. \"But recent research suggests that it is part of a broader, specific cognitive profile. Identifying this unique cognitive profile may be key to gaining a deeper understanding of synaesthesia.\" For me, living life with a mishmash of sensations brings joy. Listening to music is a fully immersive experience. I sink into an ocean of texture, as if I'm under a soft duvet or submersed in cool water. The words of a book are not just inert ink on a page, but bring the story to life as they swirl around me. And language fills the air in a kaleidoscope of colour. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "headline": "Brain surgery took my childhood memories - will new op make me forget my fiance?",
        "author": "Debbie Jackson",
        "published_date": "5 hours ago",
        "summary": "A devastating side effect made Weronkia Somerville lose 14 years of her life, and then she discovered she had to go through it again.",
        "content": "When 14-year-old Weronika Somerville woke up from brain surgery to remove a tumour, she didn't recognise the people in her hospital room. They were her parents. On the way to a post-op scan, a medic started to talk to her. He realised she had no idea who he was - despite the fact he was the surgeon who had carried out her procedure. Weronika had suffered a rare complication - unusual retrograde amnesia. She couldn't recall events or people from her past life. Her memories never returned. \"I only know from what my parents have told me,\" Weronika told BBC Scotland News. \"The doctors were checking if I knew them - I remember so many faces I hadn't seen before. \"On the way home it was petrifying – getting in a car was scary. I was just going along with what I was told to do. \"It felt like I was going home with strangers who said they were my mum and dad – my mum was showing me my room they had done up for me for after my surgery – but none of it looked like it belonged to me. \"I remember looking at my clothes and thinking who would wear this?\" Weronika, from Prestonpans near Edinburgh, said she knew it was ok to be there, but said her whole personality, and her family relationships, changed. She said: \"They never lost that connection with me, but even now, I don't think my relationship is as close as they would want it – I am more isolated and have been my own person since the surgery. \"My parents kept showing me photo albums – and that really annoyed me - they were talking and laughing about things I did when I was younger but no matter how hard I tried to focus on it, I got nothing. \"I didn't like looking at photos with them because they have emotional attachment to these moments and I don't.\" Weronika had to re-learn everything - starting with primary school maths and English. She said it took little time to re-learn as after the lessons were taught, the memory of that seemed to be unlocked - she learned her times tables after going over them twice. Back at high school, she struggled. She did not recognise any of her friends, and, starting over, she gravitated to different people. After a decade of monitoring, Weronika's tumour started to grow slowly, and in March last year, the time had come for action. Weronika - now 25 and about to be married - needed surgery. And one of her first thoughts was - would she lose her memory again? \"I was devastated,\" she said. \"The surgeon said it was definitely possible that it could happen again. But the tumour was deeper this time and I needed the surgery to improve my life expectancy.\" Weronika's treatment is followed in the new series of Surgeons: At the Edge of Life on BBC Two. In the seventh series, which follows surgeons in NHS Lothian, consultant neurosurgeon Imran Liaquat explains the jeopardy of the complicated procedure. The tumour is in the right frontal lobe of Weronika's brain – the area responsible for abstract thought, creativity and concentration. He will have to identify what is tumour and what is normal tissue then resect - or cut - around it without taking tissue that would affect brain function. Mr Liaquat said: \"Preserving cognitive function is very important - it's the essence of who we are as an individual and that can be disrupted by surgeons. We carry the complications and push the barriers of optimal resection and that does bear on you.\" He added that it was imperative to remove as much as possible. \"Evidence for tumours like Weronikas is that we need to remove at least 80-90% of the tumour to add survival advantage.\" Assisting in the operating theatre is the man who performed Weronika's original surgery when she was a teenager - consultant neurosurgeon Drahoslav Sokol. Mr Sokol said: \"It's not easy to think about doing another surgery, particularly in the context of her previous complication but we really need to remove her tumour to prevent further problems in the future.\" Weronika was terrified she would wake up and not know who her fiance Cameron was. \"The fear was that the last time it happened it changed who I was – what if I don't actually like him?\" But Cameron took it in his stride, making photographic memory books and scrapbooks of their relationship and writing notes and letters to his fiancee. He said: \"She means everything to me - absolutely everything. If she was to lose her memory I would just have to make her fall in love with me all over again and take it from there.\" Practically, Weronika wrote down all her banking details and passwords, organised a will, and wrote a letter to her partner for the worst-case scenario. Coming round from her operation, the room held its breath. \"I woke up and everyone was there – this time around I didn't feel like I had a surgery, I felt like I had a nap,\" Weronika said. \"My family were in pieces the whole time. \"But I was completely aware and I knew exactly what happened. I was able to talk. \"I saw Imran and I remember saying 'I still remember you'.\" Weronika is recovering well and married Cameron in December. She is looking forward to a happy life after 100% of the tumour was removed and she is indebted to the two men who made it happen. \"I don't think I could express my gratitude to those two surgeons enough,\" she said. \"This is the second time they have saved my life. \"When you watch it you realise what goes into it and they are like gods  - they are amazing.\" The shift from foreign aid to defence and a deal between the US and Ukraine make Scotland's front pages. Scientists in Aberdeen say the scanner could make an extraordinary difference to diagnosis and treatment. A selection of photographs submitted to BBC Scotland News from around the country this week. Mini reactors could be built in hospital basements, guaranteeing diagnosis can go-ahead. Minister Maree Todd says she is treating  issues raised in a BBC documentary \"with the utmost seriousness\".

        "headline": "Charli XCX named Brits songwriter of the year",
        "author": "Mark Savage",
        "published_date": "11 hours ago",
        "summary": "The honour is revealed ahead of Saturday's main ceremony, where the star is up for five more prizes.",
        "content": "Pop star Charli XCX has been named songwriter of the year by the Brit Awards, indicating that she could dominate this year's ceremony when it takes place on Saturday. The English singer already had the most nominations of any artist this year - five in total - recognising the global success of her agenda-setting album, Brat. The songwriting prize is her first Brit Award, and comes 12 years into her career. She has previously been nominated for best female and best pop act, but never won. In 2023, she criticised the Brits for failing to nominate any female musicians in the artist of the year category. \"We're doing everything right, I don't think it's our fault, I think it might be theirs,\" alluding to the Brits' voting academy. This year, Charli, 32, is the front-runner for best artist, where she goes up against seven-time Brit winner Dua Lipa, rap star Central Cee and indie singer Sam Fender. She is also up for album of the year, best dance act, best pop artist and song of the year - for Guess, her duet with Billie Eilish. Her long-time collaborator AG Cook was also named producer of the year by the Brits earlier this week. It caps an incredible year for the star, whose real name is Charlotte Emma Aitchison, that saw her cross over from cult pop artist to commercial success, without compromising her artistic vision. Her seventh album, Brat, was named the best album of 2024 in multiple end of year lists, with critics calling it \"pop music for the future\", and praising the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's insecurities, anxieties and obsessions. In the star's own words, the record is \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\". With it's brash, lime-green artwork, and a viral dance craze linked to the song Apple, it quickly became a cultural phenomenon, dubbed \"Brat summer\". Earlier this month, she won best dance album and best packaging at the Grammy Awards - marking her first victories at the US ceremony as a solo artist. She also closed the show with a wild performance of the singles Von Dutch and Guess, which ended with the stage being showered in underwear (later donated to the domestic violence charity, I Support Girls). The 2025 Brit Awards take place at the O2 Arena in London on Saturday, 1 March, hosted by Jack Whitehall. Performances will come from Lola Young, Sam Fender, Sabrina Carpenter, Jade, Myles Smith, The Last Dinner Party and Teddy Swims. Alongside producer and songwriter of the year, two more prizes have been announced in advance of the ceremony. Pop newcomer Myles Smith will receive the rising star award, and Espresso singer Sabrina Carpenter will be presented with the global success award. The nominees in the main categories are as follows: Artist of the year Group of the year Album of the Year Read the full list of nominees here. The ceremony will be broadcast live on ITV from 20:15 GMT. BBC News will run a live page with full coverage, including red carpet interviews.  The Mayors Fest rock show opens on 4 April and aims to raise money for three local charities. The artist says it \"feels the right time\" to once again celebrate The Prodigy singer. The Rockin' Chair singer was affectionaly known as the \"queen of the rare groove\". Smokey Robinson and Jacob Collier are set to join Rodgers at the July event. Music stars including Kate Bush and Damon Albarn say law changes would damage people's livelihoods. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "headline": "Artists release silent album in protest against AI using their work",
        "author": "Paul Glynn",
        "published_date": "1 day ago",
        "summary": "Music stars including Kate Bush and Damon Albarn say law changes would damage people's livelihoods.",
        "content": "More than 1,000 musicians - including Annie Lennox, Damon Albarn and Kate Bush - released a silent album on Tuesday in protest at the UK government's planned changes to copyright law, which they say would make it easier for AI companies to train models using copyrighted work without a licence. Under the new proposals, AI developers will be able to use creators' content on the internet to help develop their models, unless the rights holders elect to \"opt out\". The artists hope the album, entitled Is This What We Want?, will draw attention to the potential impact on livelihoods and the UK music industry. All profits will be donated to the charity Help Musicians. \"In the music of the future, will our voices go unheard?\" Kate Bush said in a statement. A public consultation on the legal changes closes later on Tuesday. The album - also backed by the likes of Billy Ocean, Ed O'Brien of Radiohead and Bastille's Dan Smith, as well as The Clash, Mystery Jets and Jamiroquai - features sound recordings of empty studios and performance spaces, demonstrating what the artists fear is the potential impact of the proposed law change. The tracklisting for the record simply spells out the message: \"The British government must not legalise music theft to benefit AI companies.\"  The government is currently consulting on proposals that would allow AI companies to use material that is available online without respecting copyright if they are using it for text or data mining. Generative AI programmes mine, or learn, from vast amounts of data like text, images, or music online to generate new content which feels like it has been made by a human. The proposals would give artists or creators a so-called \"rights reservation\" – the ability to opt out. But critics of the plan believe it is not possible for an individual writer or artist to notify thousands of different AI service providers that they do not want their content used in that way, or to monitor what has happened to their work across the whole internet. A spokesman for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said in a statement on Tuesday that the UK's \"current regime for copyright and AI is holding back the creative industries, media and AI sector from realising their full potential - and that cannot continue\". \"That's why we have been consulting on a new approach that protects the interests of both AI developers and right holders and delivers a solution which allows both to thrive. \"We have engaged extensively with these sectors throughout and will continue to do so.\" They added that \"no decisions have been taken\" and \"no moves will be made until we are absolutely confident we have a practical plan that delivers each of our objectives.\" Imogen Heap, Yusuf aka Cat Stevens and Riz Ahmed have also backed the silent album release as well as Tori Amos and Hans Zimmer. Composer Max Richter, another of the artists involved in the album, noted how the plans not only have an impact on musicians but \"impoverish creators\" across the board, from writers to visual artists and beyond. In 2023, UK music contributed a record £7.6 billion to the economy. Organiser of the silent record, Ed Newton-Rex, said the proposals were not only \"disastrous for musicians\" in the UK but also \"totally unnecessary\", as the country can be \"leaders in AI without throwing our world-leading creative industries under the bus\". He said the new record showed that \"however the government tries to justify it, musicians themselves are united in their thorough condemnation of this ill-thought-through plan.\" Singer-songwriter Naomi Kimpenu added: \"We cannot be abandoned by the government and have our work stolen for the profit of big tech.\" She said the plans would \"shatter the prospects of so many emerging artists in the UK\". In January, Sir Paul McCartney told the BBC the proposed changes to copyright law could allow \"rip off\" technology that might make it impossible for musicians and artists to make a living. In a letter to The Times, published on Monday, signatories including Sir Paul, Lord Lloyd Webber and Sir Stephen Fry said that changes to the law will allow big tech to raid the creative sectors. They were joined by the likes of Bush, Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa and Sting in opposing plans to change copyright laws. On Tuesday, the UK's creative industries launched a campaign to highlight how their content is at risk of being given away for free to AI firms. The Make it Fair campaign, which includes wrap-around adverts in national newspapers, is urging people to write to their MPs to object to the government's plans. The Mayors Fest rock show opens on 4 April and aims to raise money for three local charities. The honour is revealed ahead of Saturday's main ceremony, where the star is up for five more prizes.

        "summary": "The Rockin' Chair singer was affectionaly known as the \"queen of the rare groove\".",
        "content": "Tributes have been paid to Gwen McCrae, the much-loved and influential US funk and soul singer, who has died aged 81 after a long illness. Affectionately known as the \"queen of the rare groove\", McCrae had a 1975 soul smash with Rockin' Chair. Her catalogue - which also includes the dancefloor anthem All This Love That I'm Givin', as well as other tracks like 90% of Me Is You, Keep the Fire Burning and Funky Sensation - has been heavily sampled by artists including Lady Gaga, Cassius, Avicii, Madlib, Cypress Hill and Mobb Deep. The singer died on Friday in Miami, Florida, her family confirmed in a statement to the BBC late on Monday. \"While we will miss her dearly and our hearts are heavy, we find solace in knowing she is no longer suffering from the pain she endured in the last few years of her 81 years of life,\" added daughters Wanda, Sophia, Leah and son Alex. They added they now wished to \"celebrate\" the \"remarkable legacy\" of a \"talented and gifted artist\". \"She poured her love into what she did, and cherished her family, friends, and adoring fans worldwide.\" From around the music world, Disclosure and Dave Pearce led the tributes to the singer. \"Rest in peace the great Gwen McCrae,\" posted English electronic duo Disclosure. DJ Dave Pearce said: \"Sad to learn of the passing of soul legend Gwen McCrae - thanks for all the amazing tunes...\" Born Gwen Mosley in Pensacola, Florida into a church-going musical family, the star started singing in the church choir aged seven. She began her career as a teenager singing in local clubs with groups such as The Lafayettes and The Independents. She then met a young navy sailor and singer named George McCrae who she married within a week of meeting. And the couple signed to Henry Stone and Steve Alaimo's TK Records, which would provide the groundwork for the later disco explosion. Gwen McCrae found success on the R&B chart as a solo artist with 1970 single Lead Me On. And in 1972 she released Always on My Mind, a track that would go on to be a hit for the likes of Elvis Presley, the Pet Shop Boys and Willie Nelson. Her 1975 minor hit, It's Worth the Hurt, was eclipsed by the success of her husband's mega hit Rock Me Baby, a track which had originally been meant for her. Her response came in the form of her own big hit, Rockin' Chair - penned by Willie Clarke and Clarence Reid - which helped to define the label's dance-oriented Miami sound. \"Her rich alto voice sounded like she was still singing in church, but the lyrics were pure 70s pop/soul,\" noted US music source Soul Tracks of the track. Their respective successes put a strain on the couple's marriage and they got divorced a year later.  Despite her lack of subsequent mainstream chart success in the US, McCrae went on to record well-received albums and found a following on the northern soul and rare groove scenes, becoming a cult figure among record collectors and DJs alike across the UK and Europe. She consolidated her status by recording an album of covers of TK's biggest hits including Please Don't Go - as made famous by KC & the Sunshine Band - with producer George \"Chocolate\" Perry. The singer continued to perform and record - moving in a more gospel direction - until 2012, when she suffered a stroke which impaired her ability to make music and sing. \"The only time I'm really happy is when I'm on that stage, in front of my audience,\" McCrae said in 1997, according to the Guardian. \"Then I'm the happiest woman in the world.\" Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "published_date": "1 day ago",
        "summary": "When was the last time two musicals were up for best picture? And could Adrien Brody break a record?",
        "content": "Hollywood has had another eventful year: Deadpool faced off with Wolverine, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni sued each other, Inside Out 2 conquered the box office and Joker's sequel emphatically did not. The Oscars race, meanwhile, played out against the grim backdrop of wildfires which devastated Los Angeles and left thousands of homes destroyed. Awards season had its fair share of scandal. While The Brutalist's use of AI and Anora's lack of an intimacy co-ordinator were storms in a Twitter teacup, there was one genuine controversy when some historic tweets nearly brought down Emilia Pérez. Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), here are 17 of the quirks, trends, patterns, and record breakers from this year's batch of nominees. 1. This is the first time two musicals have been nominated for best picture in more than five decades. Wicked and Emilia Pérez are the first tuneful twosome to be up for the top prize since Funny Girl and Oliver! in 1969. The musical resurgence is partly down to it being twice as easy to score a best picture nomination nowadays, after the top category was expanded to 10 slots. The last musical to win best picture was Chicago in 2003. 2. Adrien Brody already holds one Oscars record, and he could break another. The US star is currently the youngest ever winner of best actor - he was 29 when he won for his performance in 2002's The Pianist. But Brody wasn't nominated again until this year, with his nod for The Brutalist. If he wins again, he will become the first person to win the leading actor category with his first two nominations. Only seven other actors currently have a 100% win rate at the Oscars from two or more nominations - Vivien Leigh, Hilary Swank, Kevin Spacey, Luise Rainer, Christoph Waltz, Helen Hayes and Mahershala Ali. 3. But Timothée Chalamet is a major threat. The Dune and Wonka star is Brody's toughest competition in best actor, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown. If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner. There isn't much in it - Chalamet would be just 10 months younger than Brody was when he won. 4. Netflix's Emilia Pérez could follow a dubious pattern for streaming films. It might have the most nominations, but the Spanish-language musical could share the same fate as other recent streaming films which were heavily nominated, but failed to follow through with many wins. Emilia Pérez is strong in a couple of categories, but it's similarly unlikely to sweep the board. Only one streaming film has ever won best picture - Apple's Coda - which only had three nominations overall. 5. Two Succession stars share a disadvantage. Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong are both nominated for best supporting actor, for their performances in A Real Pain and The Apprentice respectively. But the pair are the only two nominees in the category who don't come from best picture-nominated films. A Real Pain's absence in best picture shouldn't stop frontrunner Culkin from winning. The last person to win the category without a best picture nomination was Christopher Plummer in 2012, for Beginners. Every actor in the category this year is Oscar-nominated for the first time, except Edward Norton, who has three previous nods. 6. The Substance is the first body horror to be nominated for best picture, and only the seventh horror overall. The other six were The Exorcist, Get Out, The Silence of the Lambs, Jaws, The Sixth Sense and Black Swan. The Substance is a strong contender in best make-up and hairstyling, a category where the winner often overlaps with the acting winners. That could work in Demi Moore's favour in a tight best actress race. 7. Isabella Rossellini is nominated for an eight-minute performance in Conclave, but that isn't the shortest in Oscars history. Beatrice Straight won the same category, best supporting actress, for her role in Network, which lasted 5min 02sec. Dame Judi Dench is only marginally ahead, winning for a performance in Shakespeare in Love which lasted 5min 52sec. Winners aside, the shortest nominee is thought to be Hermione Baddeley's performance in 1959's Room at the Top, lasting 2min 19sec. On the subject of durations, The Brutalist (3hrs 35mins including an intermission) would be the fourth-longest best picture winner of all time, after Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur. 8. Sing Sing star Colman Domingo is nominated for best actor, just a year after his last nomination in the same category for Rustin. Quite an achievement, no doubt. But he has some way to go to catch up with Bette Davis and Greer Garson, who both managed five consecutive Oscar nominations in the 1930s and 40s. Just behind them are Al Pacino, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Thelma Ritter and Jennifer Jones, who each scored four back-to-back nods. Bradley Cooper, Renée Zellweger, Russell Crowe, Glenn Close, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, William Hurt, Richard Burton, Deborah Kerr, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper and Spencer Tracy all managed three in a row. 9. All five best actress nominees come from films which are also nominated for best picture. That might not sound like much, but it's the first time it's happened since 1977. The historic lack of overlap between the two categories has often been attributed to the Academy being less likely to give female-focused films the top prize. But that trend has shifted in recent years, with films featuring female leads such as Nomadland, Coda and Everything Everywhere All At Once scoring best picture. 10. Before Sebastian Stan's nomination for The Apprentice, only seven other actors had been Oscar-nominated for playing a US president. Frank Langella was recognised for his portrayal of Richard Nixon, while Daniel Day-Lewis and Raymond Massey were both nominated for playing Abraham Lincoln. Sam Rockwell was nominated for playing George W Bush, Alexander Knox for Woodrow Wilson, and James Whitmore for Harry Truman. Perhaps most notably, Sir Anthony Hopkins has been nominated twice for portraying two different presidents in separate films - once as Nixon and another as John Quincy Adams. Stan is slightly different in that he portrays Trump in his younger years as a real estate tycoon, rather than during his tenure as president, but we're still chalking that up as worthy of induction into this exclusive club. 11. Robbie Williams' biopic Better Man is nominated for best visual effects, but he also has a connection to two other films in the race. The British singer's track Swing Supreme features in a pivotal scene of Emilia Pérez, while his former Take That bandmates feature at the beginning of Anora as a remix of Greatest Day plays in a nightclub. Its prominence in the film led to the remaining members of Take That performing the song at this year's Bafta Film Awards. 12. Ralph Fiennes could be a good omen for Conclave. The last two times the British star was nominated for acting, for Schindler's List and The English Patient, his film won best picture. If Conclave wins, Fiennes would set a record for having appeared in the most best picture winners, becoming the only actor with roles in four (the other being The Hurt Locker). However, Edward Berger's absence in the best director category significantly weakens Conclave's chances. Only six films have ever won best picture without a corresponding director nomination. On the plus side, three of those have been in the last 12 years (Argo, Coda and Green Book), suggesting this is less of an obstacle than it used to be. Why wasn't Berger nominated? One possible factor is that, unlike the five directors who were, he didn't write or co-write his film's screenplay. Conclave was adapted from Robert Harris's novel by British screenwriter Peter Straughan. 13. Diane Warren really wants to win. The songwriter scored her 16th best original song nomination this year, for writing The Journey, from The Six Triple Eight. But Warren has never won. With Emilia Pérez's campaign damaged and potentially splitting votes with two songs in the category, could this finally be her year? She certainly hopes so. Earlier this month, when a film account on X asked followers: \"Which Oscar winner would make you happiest?\" Warren brilliantly replied: \"Me!\" 14. Wicked has a tall hill to climb to win best picture, having missed both a directing and screenplay nomination. It did score several technical nods as well as acting nominations for Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, but neither are frontrunners in their category. The last film to win best picture without a corresponding win in a director, screenplay or acting category was Rebecca in 1942. 15. Two nominees are following in their mothers' footsteps. I'm Still Here star Fernanda Torres is nominated for best actress - after her mother Fernanda Montenegro became the first Brazilian nominee in the same category in 1999 for Central Station. Meanwhile, Conclave star Isabella Rossellini's mother, Ingrid Bergman, was nominated for best actress six times in her career, winning twice, and won best supporting actress. 16. Anora's director could become the first person to win four Oscars for the same film. As Sean Baker was involved in so many aspects of the film's production, he could personally win best picture, editing, director and screenplay. Nobody has ever done this before. Walt Disney did win four Oscars in the same night in 1953, but for four different films. And Parasite's Bong Joon-Ho came incredibly close in 2020, but as the best international film prize technically goes to the country that submitted it rather than the director, he only took home three for his own trophy cabinet. If Anora does win the top prize, it will be the second consecutive year the director of best picture co-wins with his wife. Baker and wife Samantha Quan would follow Oppenheimer's Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas. Anora would also be the first 18-rated film to win best picture since The Departed in 2007. 17. It's official: The cat in Flow is named Flow. The delightful movie about a cat who survives a flood is a dark horse in the animated film category, having beaten box office juggernauts Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot to the prize at the Golden Globes. \"While we worked on Flow the cat didn't have a name,\" the film's director Gints Zilbalodis said earlier this month. \"We just called it the cat. \"I've heard from multiple people that they think that its name is Flow. People have even named their cats Flow now! So I think we can call the cat Flow.\" The films were part of a project aimed at capturing every day life in the Western Isles. An experiment in capturing people's experiences living in the Western Isles in the 1970s is now online. Pinewood Studios cites rising business costs as reason for scaling back its £800m expansion. Critics fear the Consett Empire could close, but the council says its plans will help it survive.

        "content": "The building of the Sydney Opera House began on 2 March 1959. But when BBC Tonight visited the construction site in 1965, it was plagued by technical problems, soaring costs, vacillating public opinion and political infighting. In 1965, BBC reporter Trevor Philpott sat overlooking Sydney Harbour as he tried to find the right metaphor to describe the vibrant, arching structures of Jørn Utzon's roof design for the Australian city's Opera House. \"It was a score of towering shells. It was a cluster of seagulls spreading concrete wings. It was a huddle of sailing boats with billowing concrete sails,\" said Philpott. He then added the caveat: \"And it was an unmitigated bitch to build.\" The fraught saga of the Sydney Opera House's construction began on 2 March 1959, 66 years ago this week. Six years after that, when BBC Tonight's Philpott went to see the building's progress, it was already years behind schedule, mired in spiralling costs, changing designs and escalating political tensions. To say it was having a difficult birth would be an understatement. The idea to build an opera house for the city had been proposed in the late 1940s by an acclaimed English conductor, Sir Eugene Goossens. At the time, Goossens was something of a celebrity in the classical music world, having carved out a successful career in the UK and the US. After World War Two, he had been lured to Sydney to become the director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music with the promise of a salary greater than that of the Australian Prime Minister, musicologist Dr Drew Crawford told the BBC podcast A Very Australian Scandal in 2023. The creation of a new, world-class music performance venue was the conductor's passion project. He had spied from his office window what he believed was the ideal site for it – the tram depot at Bennelong Point. Known to the local indigenous Gadigal people of the Eora nation as Tubowgule, it was a place where Aboriginal celebrations had been held for thousands of years. Throughout the 1950s, Goossens lobbied hard, trying to turn his dream into a reality. \"There were very few other people who could have that vision, articulate that vision, and have the ear of the Premier [of New South Wales], have the ear of the Prime Minister, be able to talk to people to get it going,\" said Dr Crawford. Goossens convinced the Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Cahill, that an opera house would reshape the world's view of Australia, that he had found the perfect site for it, and that they should launch \"a grand competition, open to the architects of all the world, to decide exactly what manner of a building they should put there\", said Philpott. \"They made only one condition, that nothing quite so remarkable should have been ever built before.\" Goossens himself would not get to see his ambition realised. In 1956, having just picked up his knighthood in the UK, he was detained upon his entry back into Australia, where his bags were searched and found to contain, among other things, smuggled pornography, compromising photographs and rubber masks. The resulting scandal, which involved affairs, erotica and witchcraft, completely scuppered the conductor's career in Sydney. He fled the country for Rome, traveling under the alias of Mr E Gray, never to return. However, the design competition went ahead as planned, with a panel of judges evaluating some 233 submitted entries. At the start 1957, the government announced that a largely unknown Danish architect, Utzon, was the unexpected winner. Part of the surprise at Utzon's success was that his entry had largely consisted of preliminary sketches and concept drawings. \"As far as building anything of any scale, he hadn't really done very much,\" Sir Jack Zunz, who worked on the project for the civil engineering firm Arup, told BBC Witness History in 2018. The judges' choice of Utzon's bold and imaginative design was not without controversy. \"From the first, it stirred the people of Sydney to breathless wonder and scalding abuse,\" said Philpott. \"It was called the Sydney Harbour monster, a piece of Danish pastry, a disintegrating circus tent.\" Premier Cahill, worried that the project might be derailed by adverse public opinion or political opposition, pushed for construction work to start early. This was despite the fact that Utzon was still finalising the building's actual design, and had yet to resolve critical structural issues. Although Utzon's design was thought to be one of the cheapest, there were still problems raising money for it, so a State Lottery was launched in 1957 to help fund the project. The initial estimate of the final cost of the Sydney Opera House was put at A£3.5m or A$7m – at the time, Australia's official currency was the pound, but was replaced by the dollar in 1966. The building was set to open on 26 January 1963: Australia Day. Both of these predictions would prove to be wildly and hopelessly optimistic. \"Right from the beginning, the house was full of trouble: human, mechanical, structural,\" reported Philpott. The building of the Opera House was divided into three distinct phases: construction of the podium, the roof shells, and the interior. Cahill, having persuaded the Minister of Transport to agree to the tram depot being demolished to build the podium, \"found the site was neither big enough nor strong enough to carry that structure that seemed on paper light enough to fly away,\" said Philpott. To bear the weight of the Opera House, the whole site needed to be extended and reinforced by driving over 550 steel-cased concrete shafts, each three feet in diameter, into land in and around Sydney Harbour. This extensive work, which had not been accounted for in either the construction's budget or its timescale, dragged on, hampered by bad weather. The podium would only be completed in January 1963 – the original date for when the Opera House was meant to open. But this would merely be the first of the project's delays and eye-watering extra costs. The Opera House's most distinctive feature, its roof shells which mimicked a ship's sails, were to present a whole other set of engineering headaches. Initially, the plan had been to make the roof out of steel coated with concrete. However, that design presented unwelcome noise problems for any performance taking place. \"The Opera House stars would have been singing above the sirens of the tugboats on the water outside, and the temperature variations would have caused the metal and concrete to rumble and crack like tropical thunder,\" said Philpott. Nobody had also fully understood the scale of the engineering challenge that the Opera House's daring curved roof surfaces presented. Since Utzon's entry lacked detailed engineering plans, civil engineering firm Arup had been brought in to work out how to construct the roof's complex shell structure. But despite trying multiple different redesigns, they could not make the structural calculations add up. \"The first thing Arup did when they were asked to collaborate, they took these free shapes and developed a series of mathematical models which, near as possible, matched Utzon's competition design. None of these shapes appeared buildable,\" Zunz told BBC Witness History. Another issue was that, because the roof was curved, each concrete rib that supported it would be different. That meant that instead of having just one mould that could be reused to cast all the supporting beams, each individual rib would need a separate one. This was prohibitively expensive. The answer, Utzon would later claim, came to him while he was peeling an orange. The architect realised that all segments of the roof could come from the geometry of a single sphere. By identifying which part of the sphere best suited the shapes they needed, a series of triangles each with one curved side could be cut from it, creating a variety of shells. These spherical shell segments could be broken down into individual components, which could be uniformly pre-cast in concrete and assembled onsite. \"He came back a week later and said, 'I've solved it.' And he made the scheme out of a sphere,\" said Arup's Zunz. \"But in so doing, he had changed the architecture quite radically.\" In History In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter. This elegant solution simplified the roof's construction and reduced waste, enabling the building of the vaulted roof to begin in 1963. But as the contractors worked on executing Utzon's vision, the project was dogged by labour disputes, design changes and rising material costs, making its budget balloon and its potential completion date disappear into the distance. \"By 1962, the cost had risen to A£12.5m, and now everybody admitted they were only guessing,\" said Philpott. \"The opening day was postponed and postponed again. It had been planned for Australia Day 1963, it was put off until early 1964, then until sometime in 1966, and now no one is bold enough even to predict the year the doors may eventually open.\" The project's biggest government supporter, Premier Cahill, had taken ill just months after building work had started. On his deathbed in 1959, he had made his Minister for Public Works, Norman Ryan, promise not to let the Opera House fail. Ryan, when interviewed by the BBC's Philpott in 1965, gamely made a spirited defence of the project, but by this time frustration with its mounting costs and endless delays was palpable. \"I wasn't sure whether to admit to working on it at the time,\" admitted Zunz. \"If you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted, and God knows what.\" Adding to this contentious atmosphere, a few months after Ryan's BBC interview, Robert Askin, who had vocally opposed the project, was elected the New South Wales Premier. He appointed Davis Hughes as the new Minister for Public Works, who clashed repeatedly with Utzon. Hughes, determined to rein in spending, began to challenge the architect's costs and schedules, demanding a full set of working drawings for the interiors – the next stage of the project. \"The whole situation started going downhill,\" said Zunz. \"Utzon couldn't, wouldn't, anyway didn't produce the documents his client desired.\" In retaliation, Hughes refused the payments demanded by the construction team, which left Utzon unable to pay his staff. In 1966, the Danish architect resigned from the project and left Australia, never returning to see his Opera House completed. Utzon's resignation led to a public outcry, with 1,000 people taking to Sydney's streets on 3 March 1966 to demand that he be reinstated. Instead, Hughes appointed a new panel of Australian architects to complete the interior as well as the glass walls. But if Hughes thought this would reduce costs and speed up the project, he was very much mistaken. The new team scrapped most of Utzon's plans for the interior and radically redesigned it. Utzon had envisioned a dual purpose for the main hall, as an opera venue and a concert hall, but this was now viewed as unworkable, leading to the already installed stage production machinery having to be demolished. The new design also meant that each of the hundreds of pieces of glass in the interior walls needed to be cut to a unique size and shape, which continued to pile on the costs. The Sydney Opera House's spiralling bill was pushed even higher when a labour dispute by union workers, over the dismissal of a worker and demands for better wages, culminated in a sit-in strike at the site in 1972. But the following year, the monumental undertaking that was the construction of the Sydney Opera House was finally completed. Ten years late and 14 times over its initial budget, it came in at a cost of A$102m (£51m). It was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973. The monarch praised the stunning building that had \"captured the imagination of the world\" while also wryly mentioning that \"I understand that its construction has not been totally without problems\". Utzon declined to attend its opening, writing to Premier Askin that he couldn't \"see anything positive\" in the interior work done by the Australian architects and it would not be possible for him \"to avoid making very negative statements\". More like this: • The first ever video game console • How the fall of the Berlin Wall reshaped Europe • How music saved a cellist's life in Auschwitz The Danish architect did end up making peace and reengaging with the Sydney Opera House project in 1999, agreeing to work on the A$66m (£33m) renovation of its interior. In September 2004, the Reception Hall was renamed the Utzon Room in his honour after being redesigned by him. In the years since its completion, acclaim for Sydney Opera House's visionary architecture has only grown. Its distinctive sculptural form has made it one of the most immediately recognisable buildings in the world. More than 10.9m people visit it annually, and it has come to epitomise the Australian national identity, its soaring roof a celebration of creativity, culture and ambition in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. As a venue, it has played host to everyone from Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald and Sammy Davis Jnr to The Cure, Björk and Massive Attack. In 1980, Arnold Schwarzenegger won his final body-building title there, and 10 years later anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela made one of his first major speeches from its steps following his release from prison. In 2004, Cathy Freeman, the first Aboriginal athlete to win an individual Olympic gold medal, opened the Olympic torch relay from outside the building. Its eye-catching roof is illuminated every year as part of Vivid Sydney, the city's festival of light, music and ideas, and in 2017, stories of Indigenous Australia told in vibrant animations were projected onto it. In 2007, the building that had been brought about by a combination of art, engineering and sheer bloody-minded perseverance was formally recognised as a World Heritage Site by Unesco. On recommending its inclusion, the International Council on Monuments and Sites declared: \"The Sydney Opera House stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th Century but in the history of humankind.\" -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

        "content": "In the past month alone, shadowy portraits have been found hidden in longstanding masterpieces by Titian and Picasso. What can they and other such discoveries tell us? Something's stirring. Every few weeks, it seems, brings news of a sensational discovery in the world of art – of paintings hidden under other paintings and vanished visages twitching beneath the varnish of masterpieces whose every square millimetre we thought we knew. This past month alone has brought to light the detection of mysterious figures trapped beneath the surface of works by Titian and Picasso. But what are we to make of this slowly swelling collection of secret stares – these absent presences that simultaneously delight and disturb? In early February, it was revealed that researchers at the Andreas Pittas Art Characterization Laboratories at the Cyprus Institute, using advanced imaging and a new multi-modal scanner combining different techniques, had proved the existence of an upside-down portrait of a mustachioed man holding a quill beneath the Italian Renaissance master Titian's painting Ecce Homo, 1570-75. On its surface, Titian's canvas portrays a bedraggled Jesus, hands bound by ropes, standing shoulder to shoulder with a sumptuously dressed Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor who will sentence him to death. What is this strange, erased, anachronistic scribe doing here and what is he trying to tell us? The presence of the hidden portrait, who peers imperceptibly through the craquelure – those alluring cracks in old master paintings – was first described by the art historian Paul Joannides and its significance to the surface narrative is more than incidental. While the identity of the topsy-turvy figure has yet to be determined, it is clear he helped shape the wrenching composition under which he has been buried for the past 450 years. The analysis of the materiality of the painting's layers in Cyprus has shown that the contours of the hidden figure's face dictated the curve of ropes binding Jesus's hands – establishing notes of harmony between the successive and seemingly contrary compositions. That sense of quiet collaboration between layers of paint – between what is there and what used to be there – is more striking still in the hidden countenance of a woman found by conservators at The Courtauld Institute of Art beneath a painting from Pablo Picasso's Blue Period – a portrait of the artist's friend and sculptor Mateu Fernández de Soto. Also discovered with the use of infrared imaging technology, the portrait of the as-yet unidentified woman is rendered in an earlier, more impressionistic style, and appears, when brought to the surface, to be whispering into de Soto's ear, as if the past and present had merged into a single suspended moment. In most instances, these buried portraits are merely the ghosts of rejected compositions that we were never intended to see – and could not have, were it not for the aid of advanced imaging tools that allow experts safely to peer beneath the paint without harming a work's surface. X-rays uncover hidden sketches, while infrared reflectography is capable of exposing subtle details masked by old varnish – details which, once glimpsed, are impossible to unknow. Once revealed, these portraits demand to be reckoned with. What follows is a short survey of some of the most intriguing and mysterious portraits – very often self-portraits – found wriggling restlessly beneath familiar masterpieces: unsettling presences that remain forever immeasurably close and worlds away. Think of Rembrandt and we tend to think first of that dim, imperishable realm in which his sitters sit outside of time – an eternal stage crafted from charcoal and sombrous umber. What we don't think of is giddy greens and garish vermilions igniting the space with vibrancy and verve. But that is exactly what researchers found staring back at them when they subjected the Dutch master's painting, An Old Man in Military Costume, to macro X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) imaging and infrared reflectography. Trapped beneath Rembrandt's meditation on mortality, a giddy ghost of jaunty youth clad in raffish reds and incorrigible verdigris intensifies the poignancy of his masterwork. With some paintings, the more we see the less we know. Take Artemisia Gentileschi's portrait of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, 1619. X-ray analysis of the Italian Baroque artist's work undertaken in 2019 revealed that she began the work as a self-portrait – one that closely resembles an earlier, and similarly entitled, Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria, begun around 1615. Disentangling the two works' faces is tricky but scholars now think that the final work – which swaps a turban for a crown and a piercing stare for a pious, heavenly gaze – blends elements of the artist's own likeness with those of Caterina de' Medici, daughter of the Grand Duke Ferdinando de' Medici, who commissioned the work. The result is proof that while an artist may be able to let go of a painting, a painting can never completely let go of the artist. Caravaggio only signed one painting during his lifetime and did so with ghoulish flair in a squiggle of blood at the bottom of the largest painting he ever made, The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist, 1608. But that is hardly the only time the Italian master inserted a semblance of himself into his paintings. In 2009, scholars using advanced reflectography penetrated the cracked surface of Caravaggio's depiction of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, to rehabilitate a tiny self-portrait that he had secreted in the reflection of the carafe (an almost subliminal detail that clumsy restoration efforts had obscured after the portrait-within-a-portrait was first discovered in 1922). This strange, distorted, now-you-see-it-now-you-don't selfie in the vessel of wine is key to the work's meaning, amplifying as it does themes of drunken illusion and elastic identity that are central to Caravaggio's painting. On the surface, Young Woman Powdering Herself is a playful meditation on how subject and style overlap. Here, Georges Seurat employs his pioneering pointillist technique of countless tiny dots to depict his mistress, Madeleine Knobloch, as she scatters her own flurry of powdery specks across her face. The dabs of paint seem to swirl in the air, all but clogging it – metaphorically powdering, too, anyone who stops to stare. These deftly deployed dabs of paint reveal and erase in equal measure, as if conjuring a world only to blot it out again. That sense of brilliant obliteration is intensified with the discovery of a hidden self-portrait – Seurat's only known one – in the open window which he later concealed beneath another flurry of dots depicting a vase of flowers. How dotty is that? Some people refuse to be forgotten, no matter how hard you scrub them from your memory. Italian modernist Amedeo Modigliani's famous Portrait of a Girl, 1917, is a compelling case in point. Some scholars suspect that the full-length portrait of a woman, concealed beneath the visible image, may depict an ex-lover with whom Modigliani ended a relationship a year earlier. In 2021, two PhD candidates at the University of London used Artificial Intelligence to reconstruct this hidden portrait, which strikingly resembles Modigliani's former muse and mistress, Beatrice Hastings. While the identity of both women, surface and hidden, remains uncertain, the layering reinforces themes of concealment and masking in Modigliani's work. In his painting La Cinquième Saison, 1943, René Magritte portrays in profile two nearly identical men in dark suits and bowler hats – props that often signal the presence of his alter-ego in the artist's work. Both men hold small, framed paintings under their arms as they walk towards each other. The trajectory of their strides suggests not so much an imminent collision as a near miss – an eclipse, as one figure and painting slips behind the other. It somehow seems fitting that this painting – this painting of shuffling paintings – has been found, with the use of infrared reflectography, to be hiding under its surface another painting altogether: a portrait of a mysterious woman, who at once bears a strong resemblance to the artist's wife, Georgette, and has features that are wholly distinct. The discovery of the hidden portrait merely amplifies themes of riddling duality in the work of an artist known for his treacherously teasing images. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "headline": "A glimpse at Picasso and Pollock masterpieces kept in Tehran vault",
        "author": "Armen Nersessian",
        "published_date": "17 February 2025",
        "summary": "Masterpieces by the likes of Pablo Picasso and Vincent Van Gogh feature in the collection in Iran's capital.\n\n",
        "content": "It has been dubbed one of the world's rarest treasure troves of art but few people outside its host country know about it. For decades, masterpieces by the likes of Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh, Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock have been kept in the basement of a museum in Iran's capital Tehran, shrouded in mystery. According to estimates in 2018, the collection is worth as much as $3bn. Only a small portion of the work has been exhibited since the 1979 Iranian Revolution but in recent years, the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art has been showcasing some of its most captivating pieces. The Eye to Eye exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in October 2024, was extended twice due to overwhelming public demand, running until January 2025. The display was widely regarded as one of the most significant exhibitions in the history of the museum, and it also became its most visited. The showcase featured more than 15 works unveiled for the first time, including a sculpture by Jean Dubuffet - marking its first-ever appearance in an Iranian exhibition. From abstract expressionism to pop art, the collection at the museum serves as a time capsule of pivotal artistic movements. Among the artwork is Warhol's portrait of Farah Pahlavi - Iran's last queen - a rare piece blending his pop art flair with Iranian cultural history. Elsewhere, Francis Bacon's work called Two Figures Lying on a Bed with Attendants shows figures appearing to spy on two naked men lying on a bed. On the opposite wall in the basement of the museum, a portrait of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, is on display in juxtaposition. The museum was built in 1977 under the patronage of Pahlavi, the exiled widow of the last Shah of Iran who was overthrown during the revolution. Pahlavi was a passionate art advocate and her cousin, architect Kamran Diba, designed the museum. It was established to introduce modern art to Iranians and to bridge Iran closer to the international art scene. The museum soon became home to a stunning array of works by luminaries including Picasso, Warhol and Salvador Dali, alongside pieces by leading Iranian modernists, and quickly established itself as a beacon of cultural exchange and artistic ambition. But then came the 1979 revolution. Iran became an Islamic republic as the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under Ayatollah Khomeini. Many artworks were deemed inappropriate for public display because of nudity, religious sensitivities or political implications. Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Gabrielle with Open Blouse was deemed too scandalous. And Warhol's portrait of the former queen of Iran was too political. In fact, Pahlavi's portrait was vandalised and torn apart with a knife during the revolutionary turmoil. After the revolution, many of the artworks were locked away, collecting dust in a basement that became the stuff of art world legend. It was only in the late 1990s that the museum reclaimed its cultural significance during the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami. Suddenly the world remembered what it had been missing. Art lovers could not believe their eyes. Van Gogh, Dali, even Monet - all in Tehran. Some pieces were loaned to major exhibitions in Europe and the United States, briefly reconnecting the collection with the global art world. Hamid Keshmirshekan, an art historian based in London, has studied the collection and calls it \"one of the rarest treasure troves of modern art outside the West\". The collection includes Henry's Moore's Reclining Figure series - an iconic piece by one of Britain's most celebrated sculptors - and Jackson Pollock's Mural on Indian Red Ground, a vibrant example of the American's painting technique pulsing with energy and emotion. Picasso's The Painter and His Model - his largest canvas from 1927 - also features, a strong example of his abstract works from the post-cubism period. And there is Van Gogh's At Eternity's Gate - one of the very rare survivals of his first printmaking campaign during which he produced six lithographs in November 1882. But for art lovers in Britain, the collection is out of reach. The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran and says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention. Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for detention by the Iranian authorities, it says. Challenges remain for the museum which operates under a tight budget. Shifting political priorities mean that it often functions more as a cultural hub than a traditional museum. Yet it continues to be a remarkable institution - an unlikely guardian of modern art masterpieces in the heart of Tehran. An art exhibition in Wiltshire next month will display work by domestic abuse survivors. The artist says it \"feels the right time\" to once again celebrate The Prodigy singer. The mural, which features outfits of Mayall's characters, promotes a comedy festival in his memory. Delegates will unveil Hull's culture and heritage plan at an event in the House of Commons. Works to go on show cover topics as diverse as family, climate change and gender issues. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "headline": "The Baltic Express: Central Europe's new hop-on hop-off train",
        "author": "Tristan Rutherford",
        "published_date": "2 days ago",
        "summary": "The recently launched route from Prague to Gdynia on Poland's Baltic coast takes travellers directly into Central Europe's most vibrant and less-touristed towns and cities.",
        "content": "The Baltic Express bursts out of the Czech capital on a crisp winter morning. As the sky lightens, medieval Prague is streamed through the train's windows like a Netflix trailer. From armchair seats in private compartments, a city of Rococo castles and wide boulevards appears: the \"Paris of the East\", mostly unscathed by Nazi occupation in the 1940s or socialist planning in the 70s. Moments later the train hums through a timeless Czech countryside. Onion-domed churches and frozen fishing lakes scroll past as the train sprints north. The recently launched route from Prague to Gdynia on Poland's Baltic coast operates four times daily, and takes travellers directly into Central Europe's most vibrant and less-touristed cities that were previously tricky to get to. It will entice international travellers who want to combine a city break with a rural experience, followed by a holiday on the beach. The term \"Baltic Express\" is an ambitious misnomer. Think of this new 878km connection not as one of the speedy plane-killer routes trending in recent years – like London to Amsterdam or Istanbul to Ankara – custom-built to compete with budget airlines. Instead, the eight-hour trip promises a scenic history tour through overlapping empires via some of the Czech Republic and Poland's most buzzing cities, including Gdansk and Poznan. Best of all, this highly affordable and experiential journey allows passengers to hop-on and hop-off wherever they choose. My own journey started in Prague's Hlavní Nádraží station. From outside, the terminus looks like a cathedral to train travel with twin cupolas rising from its roof like Roman temples. The station was built in 1871 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which ruled Central Europe, laid train tracks around the empire as a way of weaving all trade and security through the empire's capital of Vienna. Inside the station, Nádraží Hlavní's main departure hall was decorated when the Czech Republic was part of the Soviet Empire and is a socialist rainbow of primary colours. Yet unbeknown to most passengers, one floor above sits an original waiting room styled in Art Nouveau, while a soaring dome in this higher level overlooks Romanesque statues and polished brass rails. In 2024, the fancy Foyer Café opened in an adjoining salon, serving Czech riesling and viennoiserie pastries high above the hoi polloi. It's a fine way to start a continental meander. After just one hour aboard the Baltic Express, I make my first hop-off stop at Pardubice. The 100,000-person city exudes Czech charm. The old town square is Prague-esque, with church steeples shaped like space rockets and townhouses coloured every shade of pastel. Pardubice's Austro-Hungarian townhouses are as fancily familiar as in every empire city: Sarajevo, Brno, Lviv. Yet I can count that day's tourists on one hand. Train Journeys Train Journeys is a BBC Travel series that celebrates the world's most interesting train rides and inspires readers to travel overland. Ironically, statues in Pardubice commemorate the birthplace of Czech aviator Jan Kašpar. In 1911, Kašpar flew south from Pardubice to Prague, following the railway tracks now used by the Baltic Express. The mechanical efficiency of aviation has competed with the romanticism of rail ever since. I rejoin the Baltic Express an hour before sunset. The topography rises towards the Polish border in an undulating green sheen. First oak woods, feral deer and icy streams. Then pine forests, hunting lodges and deep snows as the train climbs into the quickening night. As Europe has become borderless, only a choral chirp from passengers' cellular networks welcomes our train to Poland. I share my seating cabin with a woman named Marta Kortas who works in Gdansk's data analytics industry. \"The train has made a new connection for me because I have friends in Prague and southern Poland,\" she tells me. The region of rural Silesia flashes past in the dark, where passengers can get off for thermal springs and salt mines. Kortas lived here during Covid lockdown. \"I even dreamt I could move back and use the train to commute to my office a few days per month. Direct connections between Prague, Wroclaw and Poznan makes that dream much easier.\" More like this: •  A new night train connecting some of Europe's great cities •  Europe's stunning high-tech luxury train •  The Train d'Artouste: Europe's highest narrow-gauge train Around 20:00, I alight, alongside Polish business commuters, to spend the night in Wroclaw, Poland's historical third city. For nearly a century before 1945, Wroclaw was the German-speaking city of Breslau, and its Teutonic-Gothic train station was designed by a Prussian architect. After World War Two, however, Poland's borders shifted west and the train station formerly known as Breslau Hauptbahnhof was renamed Wroclaw Glowny – although direct services still run to Berlin on tracks laid by the German Empire more than a century ago. I wake up to Wroclaw's whirling snow and reboard the Baltic Express for the third time, strolling along the length of the eight-carriage train to gauge the passenger make-up. There are bike racks and bench tables, a dining car and coffee bar, occupied by everyone from Polish grannies to Czech work-from-homers. It's the mix anticipated by Jan Hrabáček of Czech national rail operator České Dráhy, whom I speak to en route. \"We already have a connection from Prague to Budapest and Warsaw,\" says Hrabáček, who helped develop the Baltic Express route. \"So the idea of the Czech and Polish transport ministers was to connect the quickest possible route from Prague and Wroclaw to the sea.\" Tourism, not business, will be the key summer driver: Czechs used to drive south to Croatia for holidays, says Hrabáček, but now it's expensive. \"Czech people 'found' Poland as a destination because the beaches are great and the weather has become warmer.\" The joy of the Baltic Express is that it affords a few hours in destinations one might otherwise overlook, like the Polish spa town of Kłodzko or the medieval city of Leszno. I make my penultimate pitstop in Poznan, a Polish cultural capital that has an old town square as pretty as any imagined in a Disney fairytale. I start in the square's Military Museum, where rakish Napoleonic tunics and dashing air force costumes – Polish soldiers knew how to dress – tell of a darker story. Poland has only enjoyed 50 years of independence in the last two centuries due to Austro-Hungarian, Nazi and Soviet occupiers, which makes the safeguarding of the country's culture during difficult times even more impressive. Plan your journey The Baltic Express stops at more than 20 exciting destinations, including two Unesco World Heritage sites. Break up the journey be spending a night or two in a charming Central European city en route or stop off for a few hours of sightseeing or lunch in one of the smaller towns – then jump back on the four-times-daily service. Book individual tickets via the Czech or Polish national train operator websites. Alternatively, an Interrail pass offers unlimited hop-on hop-off travel. For example, the interiors of the Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help look like a darkly atmospheric Vatican with a ceiling as kaleidoscopically intricate as a Fabergé egg. I learn that the Nazis turned the basilica into a warehouse before it was restored after World War Two. Meanwhile, Poznan's magnificent brick brewery, Stary Browar, a city in itself, was mothballed during the Soviet era. It has been reborn as a cultural space and shopping hub near the train station. At lunchtime, I embark on my final leg towards Gdansk. As a board the train, a conductor I met the day before gives me a nod of welcome. The Baltic Express is starting to feel like home. The cosiest space is the dining car. A chef grills fresh gołąbki (pork-stuffed cabbage leaves), her assistant spoons out pumpkin barley with kale and the waiter decants bottles of Łomża beer. The train catering company WARS holds a special place in Polish hearts, having catered on international rail routes from Irkutsk to Istanbul since 1948. It's a long way from a British Rail sandwich. A fellow diner is marketing consultant Karolina Paszkiewicz. \"The trains Poland had 10 years ago were slow and cold,\" she recalls. The train to Gdansk, where Paszkiewicz's clients are based, used to take nine hours from her hometown of Wroclaw. \"Today it's four and half,\" smiles Paszkiewicz, as she munches on a Polish apple pie. \"After you've eaten and opened your laptop, it's time to get off.\" We're nearly at the end of the line. Outside, the landscape freezes and flattens. A whirl of seagulls intimates that we're descending towards the sea. The natural port of Gdansk has been Poland's window on the world for seven centuries. As a member of the Hanseatic trading league, the port city exported goods around the Baltic Sea between Hamburg, Riga, Bergen and Bremen. Visible from our slowing train are handsome wharf houses where beeswax, amber and furs could be winched up from passing ships. In Gdansk, history is inescapable. The train terminal is a mirror of Colmar station in France's Alsace region, both designed by German architects when Imperial Germany governed these parts. The city's Museum of the Second World War shares how the first shots of one of Earth's greatest conflicts were fired right here. Finally, the European Solidarity Centre highlights Gdansk's shipworkers' role in helping to bring down Soviet communism decades later. What makes the Baltic Express special is its sense of interconnectedness. It's a Czech-Polish train, travelling on tracks laid by Austrians and Germans that offers the freedom to eat, sleep and explore en route. Experiential train travel has a new destination.

        "headline": "Koh Mak: The tiny island that's redefining travel to Thailand",
        "author": "Ron Emmons",
        "published_date": "3 days ago",

        "content": "With season three of The White Lotus drawing fresh waves of visitors to the already bustling shores of Phuket and Koh Samui, a very different story is unfolding across the Gulf of Thailand. As season three of The White Lotus prepares to thrust Thailand's islands into the global spotlight, drawing fresh waves of visitors to the already bustling shores of Phuket and Koh Samui, a very different story is unfolding across the Gulf of Thailand. Here, a speck of an island named Koh Mak has quietly positioned itself as a model for sustainable tourism, offering a rare vision of what the future of travel in Thailand could be. Heading towards Koh Mak's southern shores by speedboat, my first impression was disarmingly simple: golden sand curving into clear shallows while coconut palms leaned towards the sea as though caught mid-bow. There were no high-rises, no blaring beach clubs. Instead, low-slung bungalows peeked through the trees and bicycles outnumbered cars on the island's quiet roads. I checked into the Makathanee Resort next to the jetty and studied a map to get my bearings. Just 16 sq km in size, Koh Mak is flat apart from a few gentle hills, perfect for exploring by bike. Eager to tap into the island's slow rhythm, I pedalled north-east through plantations of rubber trees and coconut palms to Laem Son beach. Here, I found little more than a shack made of coconut trunks and fronds and a few deck chairs facing a blissfully empty stretch of sand. I ordered a coconut shake and enjoyed a delicious half hour soaking up the silence before heading across to the settlement of Ao Suan Yai. Even here, there was little to detract from the island's natural beauty, just several tastefully designed, low-key resorts tucked away behind a white-sand beach and a line of palms all leaning at the same angle towards the sea. As I completed my brief tour, I was amazed to realise that during my bike ride I had seen no international hotels or shopping malls, no McDonalds or KFCs and not a single 7-Eleven, which seem to be on every street corner throughout the rest of Thailand. Promoted by the Tourist Authority of Thailand (TAT) as the country's first low-carbon destination, Koh Mak has become a testing ground for how small islands can thrive without sacrificing their soul to mass tourism. Unlike its larger, better-known neighbours ­– party-friendly Koh Chang to the north and exclusive Koh Kood to the south – Koh Mak is charting a slower, quieter course. Its approach, driven by the island's long-time landowning families, has earned international recognition for sustainable tourism. But it is the lived reality that truly sets it apart. This is not an island clinging to an imagined past; it's one that is actively shaping a different kind of future. Green Getaways Green Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world. While many Thai islands fall under the jurisdiction of the Thai government, Koh Mak remains in the hands of five families, descendants of a civil servant named Luang Prompakdee who purchased the island's coconut plantations in the early 20th Century. Yodchai Sudhidhanakul, president of the Koh Mak Tourism Club and one of Prompakdee's descendants, told me that this tight-knit ownership structure has been key to protecting the island's tranquil character and encouraging slow tourism. \"It's not that we don't want tourists; in fact, many residents depend on tourism,\" Sudhidhanakul said. \"But we hope to attract a particular type of visitor – those who are respectful of others and appreciate the benefits of a quiet life.\" In 2018, residents formalised their vision in the Koh Mak Charter. The agreement bans vehicle ferries from docking at the island, restricts motorbike rentals to 70% of room capacity, prohibits loud music after 22:00 and noisy water sports like jet skis, and bans the use of foam or plastic containers. When to visit Koh Mak Koh Mak's high season is between November and April. In the low season (May to October), the island is almost deserted although boats still make the journey. Some resorts close at this time but those that remain open offer cheaper rates. \"We never worried about overtourism,\" said Sudhidhankul, \"as our available accommodation has remained at a steady 750 rooms, but we wanted to be part of the low-carbon initiative. Thus, most resort owners use renewable energy where possible and make efforts to recycle and dispose of waste responsibly.\" This ethos extends beyond policy. Local initiatives like the Koh Mak Coral Conservation Group offer snorkelling trips where visitors can learn how to propagate corals using recycled PVC pipes. Waste disposal is a collective effort, with regular beach cleanups coordinated by Trash Hero, a voluntary group with the motto, \"Every week we clean, we educate, we change\". And at the island's coconut plantation, visitors can learn how to harvest coconuts and make cold-pressed coconut oil, while tie-dye workshops teach traditional fabric-dyeing techniques using natural pigments.

Unfortunately, most of what I found would only be of interest to the Trash Heroes – plastic bottles, old shoes and torn fishing nets. There were plenty of other activities to choose from, including diving and snorkelling trips, kayaking, paddle boarding, classes in massage and cooking, Thai boxing and yoga. How to go green on Koh Mak • Rent a bicycle or golf cart to explore the island • Join the Trash Heroes on Saturday morning for their weekly cleanup • Eat local rather than imported food • Sign up for a long stay at the Koh Mak Campus • Join in any of the eco-friendly activities on offer I took part in a game of disc golf (aka frisbee golf) and joined a tie-dyeing workshop, where I made a shirt that gave me a great sense of accomplishment. Workshop leader Rodjamarn Sirirut showed us a display of more than 20 natural dyes made from local plants such as indigo, malabar, mango, mangosteen and coconut shell; impressive evidence of the island's natural diversity. These pursuits made a change from lounging at swim-up pool bars or stuffing myself at buffets as I might have done if I had been staying at an international resort. One day I joined a snorkelling trip to Koh Rang, an island to the west of Koh Mak that is part of the Koh Chang Marine National Park. On the boat I chatted with Rong Rong Zhu, a former research scientist in the US who now spends most of her time on Koh Mak. \"When I travelled in Asia in 2018, I found Koh Mak to be a very walkable and bike-friendly island,\" she said. \"I was able to rent a house with a beautiful view and now I have many digital nomad friends who spend half the year here.\" Koh Mak is not immune to the challenges facing small islands. Plastic debris still washes up on its shores, swept in by ocean currents. And while the island's co-working hub, Koh Mak Campus, set up by Sudhidhanakul in 2020, encourages longer stays and digital nomads, balancing tourism and development remains a delicate task. \"We want to attract seasonal inhabitants, and we need to develop more expertise in the use of renewable energy.\" Sudhidhanakul told me. Yet, as I slipped into the island's rhythm – cycling from one beach to another, sipping coconut shakes under palm trees and chatting with residents who spoke of their home with both pride and protectiveness – it became clear that Koh Mak offers something increasingly rare in Thailand. It is a reminder that a different kind of tourism is possible, one that doesn't require sacrificing a place's spirit for progress. As the speedboat carried me back towards the busy mainland, I found myself hoping that Koh Mak's quiet revolution might inspire others to follow its lead. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "content": "Mayara Lima is famous for her hypnotising samba style. Here, she shares the best samba experiences in Rio, from traditional school events to samba circles. Brazilians often say that \"everything ends in samba\", but perhaps it would be more accurate to say that samba never ends – at least not in Rio de Janeiro, one of the places where the musical and dance genre is said to have originated. Aside from providing entertainment, samba has played a crucial role in shaping Rio's lifestyle, including taking a central role in its Carnival celebration – the most renowned in the world. More than just a genre, samba is a cultural phenomenon that helps drive the economy, with more than 150 official rodas de samba (samba circles) across the city. At these lively gatherings, musicians sit in a circle while crowds of hundreds – or even thousands – of spectators sing along, creating an electrifying atmosphere. Meanwhile, escolas de samba (community-based \"samba schools\" that organise the world-famous Carnival parade with its giant floats and thrilling costumes) elect a rainha da bateria (queen of the drums) who leads the school's bateria (drum section), captivating the crowd and forging a powerful connection between the musicians and the audience. The SpeciaList Mayara Lima is one of Rio's most popular samba queens, having claimed the title of drum queen in 2023. She currently represents the Paraíso do Tuiuti samba school, where she gained national recognition for her mesmerising samba style. But the energy of samba can be felt in Rio all year round. Even outside Carnival season, events like samba school street rehearsals offer a vibrant and immersive experience. We asked Mayara Lima, a rainha de bateria (drum queen) at Pararaíso do Tuiti, one of Rio's most renowned samba schools, how to experience the city's rich samba culture during Carnival and beyond. Lima knew from an early age that dance was her calling, and she joined a samba school at age 10. \"I had studied other rhythms, such as ballet and jazz, but I decided to be fully dedicated to samba,\" she says. Lima is a proud carioca – a Rio native. \"To me, Rio is far more than just a city,\" she says. \"What makes Rio so unique is the way it combines breathtaking natural beauty – its beaches and trails – with the energy of a vibrant, urban metropolis, where every neighbourhood has its own distinct charm and history.\" She adds: \"[But] you can't talk about Rio without talking about samba, can you? Their histories are intertwined.\" Ahead of the 2025 Carnival, which runs from 28 February to 8 March, here are five of Lima's favorite samba experiences in Rio. Rio's samba school parade is a global spectacle every Carnival season. Of the more than 70 samba schools, only a select few belong to the elite group that takes centre stage, parading down the Sambódromo Marquês de Sapucaí during the festivities – but the schools promote several events during the year that take place in the quadras (samba school headquarters), which play a key role in strengthening ties between the schools and the local community. Tip: Rio's music scene is about more than just samba. \"Baile Charme, an old-school R&B event, under the Madureira viaduct every Saturday [starts] at 20:00 and ends at the sunrise at 05:00,\" says Lima. This event has been going strong for over 20 years and remains a huge success, attracting thousands of people every week. \"It's a great way to see another side of Rio's music scene.\" Cariocas and visitors of all ages come to samba schools to watch rehearsals, participate in feijoadas (a traditional feast of black beans and pork) and enjoy live performances of the school's samba anthem; a new one is chosen each year to serve as the narrative musical thread for each performance. \"There are 12 main samba schools [in Rio], which means 12 opportunities to experience samba,\" says Lima. \"While there's no fixed schedule for events, something is always happening. Each school hosts feijoadas several times a year. They feature guest performers playing not just samba, but also pagode [a type of samba/subgenre of samba] and carioca funk.\" For Lima, the Grêmio Recreativo Escola de Samba Acadêmicos do Salgueiro samba school holds one of Rio's best feijoadas. \"It's a thrilling event, it often happens in the first Monday of each month,\" she says. But her favourite type of samba school event is undoubtedly street rehearsals. \"As Carnival approaches, we hold street rehearsals every Monday in front of the samba school before heading inside to continue practicing,\" she says. \"It's amazing!\" Each school announces its events on social media. Street rehearsals are free, but other events, such as feijoada feast and samba circles, usually require a ticket. Website: www.salgueiro.com.br Address: R. Silva Teles, 104 - Andaraí Phone: +552238-9226 Instagram: @salgueirooriginal  Pedra do Sal – a sloping set of stone steps found in Morro da Conceição, known as Rio's \"Little Africa\" – is believed to have been the birthplace of samba in the early 20th Century. When the area served as a market for enslaved people and the unloading point for salt (sal in Portuguese) shipments, it also became a gathering place for enslaved Africans, who came together to honour their deities and play the instruments that became part of samba's DNA, like the pandeiro (tambourine). During the day, Pedra do Sal's rich history attracts small groups of tourists eager to understand Rio's past. But as the sun sets, the streets fill with vendors and hundreds of visitors drawn to the city's most famous roda de samba. Once held only on Monday nights, the event grew so popular that organisers expanded it to four nights a week, from Friday to Monday – though Monday remains the busiest night. The music spills over Pedra do Sal's famous steps, creating an electrifying, open-air celebration. \"Pedra do Sal attracts such a diverse crowd – you'll find people from all over the city, from different backgrounds, and loads of tourists too,\" says Lima. \"It's a great mix, and that reflects in the music. Samba is the essence, but you'll hear other rhythms too.\" Address: Rua Argemiro Bulcão, s/n, Saúde, Instagram: @pedradosaloficial In the city's northern zone, 21km from the historic Copacabana beach, hundreds of samba enthusiasts gather at the Pagode do Chinelo roda in the Pilares borough, right next to the renowned samba school Caprichosos de Pilares. Like most rodas de samba, the gathering started with modest expectations – just a group of friends meeting every Monday for a cold beer and some samba – but the samba do Chinelo quickly became a sensation and is now one of Rio’s official rodas de samba, attracting locals and celebrities alike, and has since evolved into a professionally structured event. \"This is one of those places everyone goes to. It's a given that it'll be packed every Monday, with plenty of famous faces in the crowd. Sometimes you even see singers like [Grammy winner] Ludmilla performing – it's really cool,\" says Lima. The event kicks off at 18:00 and carries on into the late night. Pagode do Chinelo is also the perfect spot to experience different samba styles. \"It's a great place to enjoy a more melodic samba, which is slower, or samba partido-alto, which is faster and more upbeat. It's brilliant fun,\" says Lima. Address: Rua Faleiros, 1, Pilares Instagram: @resenhapagodeechinelo 4. Best for experiencing classic samba: Cacique de Ramos The northern zone of the city is also home to one of Rio's most traditional rodas de samba. Tip: For those looking for a more laid-back way to explore Rio, Lima recommends having breakfast inside the Jardim Botânico. \"Some of the cafes in the garden allow you to enjoy a morning meal surrounded by nature overlooking century-old trees,\" she says \"It’s the perfect place to start your day in a relaxing atmosphere before exploring the city's other attractions.\" Founded in the 1960s, Cacique de Ramos became famous for its legendary samba gatherings, where some of the genre's most celebrated artists first rose to prominence. Often described as the \"headquarters of samba\", it has played a pivotal role in shaping Rio's Carnival culture. \"This is where you'll find classic samba,\" says Lima. \"Cacique de Ramos is the birthplace of many greats, including Arlindo Cruz, Zeca Pagodinho and Beth Carvalho. If you want to experience that unique energy, this is the place to go.\" The samba takes place every Sunday in Cacique de Ramos samba hall, making it an ideal option for those looking to enjoy a lively evening without a late finish. \"Since it's on a Sunday, Cacique de Ramos wraps up around midnight,\" says Lima. \"So if you need to be up early the next day but still want to make the most of your weekend, it's perfect. It's definitely one of my favourites.\" Website: www.caciquederamos.com.br Address: Rua Uranos, 1326 - Olaria Phone: +55213251-4374 Instagram: @cacique_de_ramos Baródromo is a well-known samba venue among cariocas and a favourite gathering spot for samba enthusiasts. The walls are adorned with Carnival costumes and masks, immersing guests in the samba atmosphere the moment they step inside. \"It's always buzzing, absolutely packed,\" says Lima. \"It's a bar with a proper traditional samba roda, where people clap along to the beat – it's such a great vibe. The whole place is dedicated to samba, and that's what makes it so special.\" The venue is open from Tuesday to Sunday, with samba sessions every night, ranging from performances of traditional samba to live sets from samba school baterias. Baródromo is a popular venue that frequently fills to capacity, occasionally leading to slower service. However, the lively atmosphere and infectious energy of the crowd create a fully immersive experience, with the music at its heart.

        "headline": "The sweet Dutch sandwich that makes no sense",
        "author": "Deborah Nicholls-Lee",
        "published_date": "5 days ago",
        "summary": "There's a pervasive belief in the Netherlands that this unconventional meal helps lift the national mood.",
        "content": "There's a pervasive belief in the Netherlands that this unconventional meal helps lift the national mood. \"I think I'm an addict, basically,\" says Marije Nicklin, who grew up on the Dutch island of Terschelling. The Dutch expat, who has been based in West Yorkshire, UK, since 2002, is obsessed with hagelslag, carefully rationing the packets her parents post to her and the bag-loads she brings back on the ferry. \"I've got quite a lot in storage,\" she says. \"I do start to twitch when I see the end is coming.\" Translated as \"hailstorm\", hagelslag are crispy, oblong-shaped sugar strands, just a few millimetres long. They are most commonly chocolate-flavoured and coated in a shiny glaze. In a supermarket in any other country, you'd likely see them in the cake toppings section reserved for a special occasion, but in the Netherlands, where more than 14 million kilograms of hagelslag are consumed per year, many people eat them every week, sprinkling them liberally onto buttered bread as a quick breakfast, snack or lunch. The hagelslag sandwich (broodje hagelslag) is surely an anachronism in this age of sugar awareness, but there's a pervasive belief in the Netherlands that this unconventional meal helps lift the national mood. Good hagelslag is crunchy on impact but then melts in the mouth. Each season sees new variations appear in the shops: little bunnies for Easter, for example, or orange hagelslag for Koningsdag, an annual orange-themed street party to celebrate the King's birthday. The small packs seen in many hotel breakfast buffets are ideal for novices, and a few years back, one supermarket even experimented with pick 'n' mix. Whichever variety you choose, the habit is widespread, with an estimated 750,000 hagelslag sandwiches consumed each day. Strictly speaking, hagelslag is a sugar-based vermicelli sprinkle that is chocolate or fruit-flavoured, but the name has become associated with other cheerfully packaged sugary toppings found on the same supermarket shelf, such as curly vlokken (chocolate flakes) and muisjes, sugar-coated aniseed seeds that look like tiny mice and are typically served on beschuit (rusks). In the 17th Century, aniseed was thought to aid lactation and help the womb contract, and pink or blue muisjes on beschuit are still served today to celebrate the arrival of a baby. For Nicklin, whose favourite variety is the puur (dark chocolate), the crunchiness is very important. \"It's the bite with hagelslag. I don't think you can get that with any other spread,\" she says. \"It still makes me feel happy.\" She bats back any suggestion that this sweet sandwich is messy to eat, explaining that her family use high-sided plates to catch any stray strands, which she insists are returned empty. \"It's a crime to leave any on the plate,\" she says. The first sugary toppings, in the form of aniseed muisjes, are thought to date to the late 19th Century when Cornelius Rutgerus de Ruijter sold them from his bakery in Baarn in the province of Utrecht. The brand, now known as market leader De Ruijter, expanded their production to factory-made fruit hagelslag in 1928 and chocolate hagelslag and flokken in the 1950s. World's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future. Even Dutch royalty loved the sugary treat. King Willem III made the brand a purveyor of the court in 1883. And in 1985, under Queen Beatrix, De Ruijter received the Koninklijk (royal) predicate, an honour, a spokesperson from parent company Kraft-Heinz told BBC Travel, which \"can only be carried by Dutch companies who have been officially recognised for their important position within their discipline, are at least 100 years old and are considered of national importance\". Quite a fanfare for a modest chocolate sprinkle. On an industrial estate in Tilburg – a short distance from the border with Belgium, wheresprinkles are commonly called muizenstrontjes (mouse droppings) − an immense but unremarkable building houses the world's largest hagelslag factory. Photographer Jordy Leenders from Eindhoven is one of the lucky few who has seen inside. Commissioned in 2018 to take photographs of its inner workings, he said he felt, \"like I was Charlie, being invited to the chocolate factory for a tour\". Having gone through a machine that rid him of dust and disinfected his hands and arms, Leenders, kitted out in ear defenders and factory scrubs, emerged into a space filled by what he describes as a kind of \"indoor rollercoaster… crisscrossing the room\" made up of \"mazes\" of vast conveyor belts moving the hagelslag through different stages of preparation to perfect their size, texture and shape. \"Though the smell of chocolate is strong in the early stages when you're working with a raw material, it's the noise that really hits you,\" he says, describing the sound of the hagelslag being emptied from the silos \"like pouring 2,000kg of rice into a bucket\". He notes that one of the most memorable sights was the extrusion process, which creates \"a very long string of hagelslag that they break off and cut\" before spraying it with a fine mist of sugar to give it its appealing gloss. Leenders was astounded by the \"absurd scale\" of the factory and the complex processes required \"in order to deliver a decoration to put on your sandwich\". \"When you have it in your hands, you're thinking that it is pretty simple,\" he says. For newcomers to the Netherlands, it's the foodstuff itself that can be baffling. Colleen Geske, who moved to Amsterdam from Canada in 2005, has a clear memory of the first time she encountered hagelslag. Her first employer in the Netherlands shared a cafeteria with various tech, finance and law firms. \"Every lunch hour, I would see these tables of men in suits that were eating what I could only describe as the lunch of a four-year-old,\" recalls the author of Stuff Dutch People Eat and co-host of the Stuff Dutch People Like podcast. \"They were all with cartons of milk and having their bread with hagelslag. To me, it was such a bizarre sight.\" \"Hagelslag tells us a lot about the Dutch,\" Geske adds. \"When you strip it away, the Dutch are not pretentious at all. They don't care what people think of them often… They're not over-analysing this, thinking: Is this healthy? Is this for children? They're just indulging in a relatively simple pleasure.\" Hagelslag occupies a special place in a cuisine, which is in general, \"quite practical, quite basic\", she adds. \"Hagelslag is the one kind of sparkly, shiny, interesting, funny, kind of quirky thing about a Dutch meal.\" More like this: • Is the future of French cheese at stake? • Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl • A restorative soup made for cold season But the tradition of eating this illogical little lunch is not all about the taste, she notes. \"I think, personally, that it's also this feeling of nostalgia that the Dutch have around eating hagelslag. It's like that one thing that you grew up with as a kid that you're still 'allowed' to do as an adult.\" Due to its high sugar content, her own children are only allowed it at weekends. They're very specific about how it must be made, telling Geske: \"No, you need more butter and you have to put way more hagelslag on, and it has to be evenly distributed to the very edges...\" Leenders admits that the Dutch are eating \"basically a crushed chocolate bar on their sandwich\", which, he says, \"doesn't really make sense if you're looking at it from a nutritional perspective\". But that has never put him off. \"I've been raised in the Netherlands so I'm a frequent hagelslag eater,\" he says. \"I don't think you will encounter any Dutch household without at least one pack of hagelslagin their kitchen cabinets.\" As far as Leenders is concerned, there's nothing childish about hagelslag. \"It's for all ages,\" he insists. \"I know people over 60 who still start their day with a sandwich with hagelslag on top of it.\" \"I struggle to get it in my head why they think it's for children,\" agrees Nicklin. \"My dad always had hagelslag on his bread. And she can't think why anyone would think a hagelslag sandwich makes no sense: \"If that's what they believe, then they're obviously not Dutch.\" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

        "headline": "Seven planets to be visible in night sky for last time until 2040",
        "author": "Maddie Molloy",
        "published_date": "1 day ago",
        "summary": "The best chance to see as many as possible will be after sunset on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. ",
        "content": "Skywatchers are in for a treat this week as seven planets - Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, Neptune, Mercury, and Saturn will all be briefly visible in the evening sky. This phenomenon, known as a 'planetary parade' is a rare sight, and it will be the last time seven planets can be seen simultaneously so well until 2040. The best chance to see as many planets as possible will be just after sunset on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Four of the planets - Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars - will be visible to the naked eye. Saturn will be harder to see because it will be low in the horizon. You will need a telescope to spot the other two planets - Uranus and Neptune. A good view of the horizon and clear skies will offer the best chance of spotting them all. However, the window to see all seven planets will be very brief. Dr Edward Bloomer, astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich said: \"There's a rare opportunity to have seven planets in essentially a convenient place for you to look for them.\" As the sun sets, Saturn and Mercury will also be setting, making them particularly difficult to see. \"You really only have a few minutes after sunset to catch them before they drop below the horizon. After that, you'll still be able to see Venus, Jupiter, and Mars clearly for a much longer time,\" Dr Bloomer added. The planets in our solar system orbit the Sun within roughly the same flat plane as the Earth. As they orbit at different speeds and distances from the Sun, there are moments when they appear to line up from Earth's perspective creating a spectacular visual display, although the planets remain separated by vast distances in space. Venus and Jupiter will be the easiest to spot due to their brightness, while Mars will have a distinct reddish hue. \"Uranus is technically visible with the naked eye, but you'd need perfect eyesight and ideal conditions,\" Dr Bloomer explains. To improve your chances of seeing as many planets as possible, Dr Bloomer advises heading to a location with a clear view of the horizon and minimal light pollution. \"If you just pop out of your kitchen into your back garden, you will take time to adjust to the light levels. Give it a bit of time - your eyes take about half an hour to fully adjust,\" said Dr Bloomer. \"Avoid looking at your phone, get comfortable, and ensure you have an unobstructed view of the horizon.\" While this is an exciting opportunity, Dr Bloomer encourages people to make a habit of gazing at the night sky. \"See how things change,\" he said, adding that observing the heavens is \"a chance to witness the ongoing mechanics of the solar system at work.\" Whilst the weather is still rather unsettled currently, clearer and calmer conditions are expected to develop later in the week. Tuesday evening will start with clear spells, but cloud and rain will move in from the west later. On Wednesday night, skies will be generally cloudier with showery rain at times. By Thursday, expect a drier, clearer view of the night sky. Earlier in the evening is best, as mist and fog patches may develop further into the night. For Friday high pressure is expected to dominate, keeping dry conditions for most with clear spells. Soon after sunset is most favoured as mist and fog patches may develop later. Additional reporting by Sarah Keith-Lucas of BBC Weather Stargazers will be treated to a rare seven-planet alignment in February. This is what scientists hope to learn.

        "headline": "Why a mega river-linking plan has sparked massive protests in India",
        "author": "Vishnukant Tiwari",
        "published_date": "2 days ago",
        "summary": "The project aims to channel surplus Ken river water to a drought-prone region.",
        "content": "Thousands of villagers in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh are protesting against a multi-million-dollar river-linking project which, they say, will rob them of their homes and livelihoods. The Ken-Betwa project, with a budget of 440bn rupees ($5.06bn; £4.05bn), will channel excess water from the Ken river in Madhya Pradesh to the Betwa river in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state through a network of tunnels, canals and a dam. It is the first of 16 such river-linking projects earmarked under India's National Perspective Plan for water resource development in the 1980s. The plan faced multiple delays - mainly due to environmental concerns and political disputes - before the government cleared it in 2021. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for its construction in December last year. The project is supposed to help the drought-prone Bundelkhand region - which includes parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh - where arid climate and unpredictable rainfall patterns have led to decades of poverty and underdevelopment. The government says that once completed in 2030, it will help irrigate 1.06 million hectares of land, provide drinking water to 6.2 million people and generate 130MW of hydropower and solar energy. But at least 10 villages, including vast swathes of precious forest land, will be submerged to build the dam's reservoir and 11 more villages will be displaced for constructing the canal, affecting more than 7,000 families, district officials say. \"Our livelihoods are tied to this land - we don't know what the future holds for us anymore,\" said Tulsi Adivasi, who is among the thousands of villagers protesting against the project. Most of them belong to the indigenous Gond and Kol tribes, who live along the edge of forests and depend on farming for a living. Environmental experts warn the project will submerge nearly 98 sq km (38 sq miles) of the Panna Tiger Reserve, a 543 sq km sanctuary that successfully brought tigers back from local extinction in 2009. This could undo years of conservation efforts. \"It's unprecedented. We have never seen a core area of a national park being used for such a large-scale infrastructure project before,\" says environmentalist Amit Bhatnagar. In 2019, a panel of experts constituted by India's top court had also raised concerns about the project, questioning its economic viability and impact on the region's wildlife. The government, it said, should explore alternative irrigation methods in the river basin. Independent studies on river-linking projects in India have made similar observations. A 2023 study published in the Nature Communications journal states that such endeavours \"may worsen the water stress across the country, making these projects ineffective or possibly even counterproductive\". Baleshwar Thakur, who heads the National Water Development Agency, however, defended the project, saying authorities had conducted a thorough research and acquired all environmental clearances for the project. \"We have also designated additional land to offset the loss of tiger habitats and will rehabilitate other species affected by the project as well,\" he said. The government official admitted that there would be a potential \"challenge\" to the biodiversity of the region, but said that \"the benefits of the project outweigh the adverse impacts\". The assurances have done little to comfort the villagers. In the heart of Daudhan, 48-year-old Mahesh Adivasi sat with a group of men, who voiced their dissent in the form of a protest song. \"Ken-Betwa dam is built by the government, it gives others water but drowns us,\" they sang, the lyrics capturing their anguish. The village is one of the poorest areas in the region, lacking basic facilities such as clean drinking water and electricity. The bitter irony of the river project isn't lost on its people - they ask why they are being asked to abandon their homes to provide electricity in 13 other districts when their own village has never had power. \"We have seen generations pass without progress. Now, we are being asked to sacrifice our lives for others' progress. What about us?\" Mahesh Adivasi said. The government has offered villagers an optional compensation plan, where they can either opt for a piece of land along with 750,000 rupees ($8,655; £6,842) or a one-time payout of 1,250,000 rupees. For those who own land, an additional amount based on the land's value will also be given. Mr Thakur said that about 90% of the people had chosen to take the lump sum amount. \"In the meantime, the government has started looking for alternative government land to resettle the villagers,\" he added. But locals say the amount being offered is insufficient. Tulsi Adivasi showed BBC Hindi a government notice which evaluated his house at 46,000 rupees. \"Can a house be built with this much money?\" he asked. Others complain they have not been informed when they must evacuate or where they'd be resettled, fuelling anxieties about their future. \"The project should have been a blessing for our village but, the truth is, it will plunge us further into darkness,\"  said Lakshmi Adivasi, 20. Questions have also been raised against the claim that the project is meant to channel excess water from the Ken river. Critics point out that the government has relied on outdated data from 2003, without independent verification, to calculate the river's annual yield. Mr Thakur denied the allegation and said authorities \"have all the data to continue with the project\". Mr Bhatnagar, the environmentalist, said that by going ahead with the project, the government was setting \"a dangerous precedent\" for similar development programmes to be carried out in other geologically sensitive areas. \"And for those affected, it once again underscores how development in India often comes at the cost of the most marginalised,\" he added.

        "headline": "From Baywatch to toxic waste - LA's iconic beaches unrecognisable after fires",
        "author": "Regan Morris",
        "published_date": "3 days ago",
        "summary": "Under orders from President Trump, the EPA is trying to fast track the clean-up of toxic debris from LA's fires.",
        "content": "With its sun-drenched lifeguard towers, bronzed surfers and bikini-clad volleyball players, Will Rogers State Beach is one of the most recognizable stretches of sand in the world thanks to the global cult classic \"Baywatch\". But now the iconic beach is surrounded by the ruins of burned homes and palm trees, its parking lot a sorting ground for hazardous waste from the wildfires. The beach babes have been replaced by Environmental Protection Agency crews in hazmat suits sifting through melted electric car batteries and other hazardous waste before it's trucked away to landfills. The Palisades and Eaton fires generated a staggering amount of debris, estimated to be 4.5 million tonnes. In comparison, the devastating Maui fires of 2023 generated about 400,000 tonnes, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers. Those fires took three months of clean-up by the EPA, which is in charge of removing hazardous waste. But now the agency is hoping to finish their job in LA in just a month - by 25 February - after President Donald Trump signed an executive order demanding the EPA \"expedite the bulk removal of contaminated and general debris\". The decision to sort through the hazardous waste along the coast has prompted protests and as the clean-up of fire debris moves at unprecedented speeds, many are asking if and when the ocean water will be safe for swimming and surfing. \"In this very vulnerable place, they're sorting this very hazardous, hazardous stuff,\" said actor and environmentalist Bonnie Wright. \"To me, this feels like 10 steps backwards, because you're literally putting this waste even closer to the beach than it already is in the burn sites.\" Ms Wright, who played Ginny Weasly in the Harry Potter films, wrote a book on sustainability and devotes most of her time now to environmental causes. While their battle to move sorting sites away from the coast ultimately failed, she said activists were successful in urging the EPA to move burned electric vehicle batteries to the Will Rogers site down the road and away from the sensitive Topanga Creek watershed. The EPA said the burned vehicle batteries are an especially dangerous challenge but that the agency has the expertise to deal with them. To sift waste, they need a large space with roads big enough for truck traffic - which is why the Pacific Coast Highway, which runs along the beach, is more attractive than inside the windy, mountainous roads of the Palisades. When lithium ion batteries are damaged - especially by the high heat and flames of a wildfire - they have the potential for reigniting and exploding days, weeks, or even months after they've been impacted, said Steve Calanog, the EPA's incident commander for the LA fires. \"We have to treat them like unexploded ordinance, or, as the military calls it UXO,\" he said. Although some have questioned the speed with which the EPA has moved to clean up the toxic debris, he said there is no time to waste. \"We have to do this very quickly,\" he said, noting that they started sorting waste even as the fires were still raging. \"If we are delayed, the risk of impacting the ocean, it goes up again.\" Mr Calanog was also in charge of the EPA response to the Maui fires, which may hold clues for how to measure what is safe and reasonable when it comes to testing water and soil samples. Many are concerned about the impacts of heavy metals and chemicals in the air and water after the fires. In Maui, it's been nearly 18 months since the fires and a small part of the coast around Lahaina is still closed to the public. The Army Corps of Engineers - which removes heavy debris after the EPA removes hazardous waste - just finished their last haul from Lahaina on 20 February. But most of Maui has remained open to locals and tourists and the Hawaii Department of Health announced eight months after the fires that the coastal waters around Lahaina were safe for ocean recreation. The scale of the clean-up from the Los Angeles fires, however, is unprecedented and the largest in US history. LA County closed beaches along a nine-mile (14 km) stretch for weeks following the fires in January. Then torrential rain - while helping douse any smouldering embers - caused mudslides in the burn area and runoff of toxic ash and chemicals into the ocean, prompting further closures. Now most beaches are reopened but a water advisory remains in effect along the coast from Santa Monica to Malibu until further notice advising \"beach goers may recreate on the sand but continue to be advised to stay away from visible fire debris and to stay out of the ocean water during any posted ocean advisory\". Only the most dedicated and local surfers could access the beaches in the burn area anyway - there's no parking or stopping for about 9 miles along Pacific Coast Highway, which is clogged with trucks and workers cleaning up debris. Though some will risk most anything to catch a good wave. While touring the EPA sorting site, Annelisa Moe said she saw two surfers in the water at a popular surf break on Topanga Beach while she watched workers across the street in full PPE handling burned EV car batteries. \"The water looked like chocolate milk with like brown foam on it,\" recalled Ms Moe, who is the associate director of Science & Policy, Water Quality at Heal the Bay, an environmental nonprofit dedicated to making coastal watersheds healthy. \"It was one of those days, in between storms, like beautiful, sunny, 75 degree weather type of days,\" she said. \"And so it felt a little bit odd to be there amidst the destruction while we have this perfect beach day.\" Jenny Newman of the Los Angeles regional water quality control board told an LA County Public Health virtual town hall on 18 February that the initial water quality tests they conducted on 22-27 January \"came back better than we expected.\"  But the water board cautioned that people should follow county advisories to stay out of the water near the burn site. Dozens of scientists and volunteers from Heal The Bay and a myriad of private and public sector agencies have also been testing water and soil samples to see what levels of forever chemicals and heavy metals are present in the ocean, but toxic analysis can take 4-6 weeks and there's very little data available. At the Surfrider Foundation, volunteers test the ocean water all year long. But their small lab is testing for fecal bacteria - not arsenic. Now it's too dangerous to expose volunteers in the burn areas, so the staff have partnered with Heal the Bay and the University of Southern California to process their water samples. \"All our community members are ocean lovers. We have the same questions they have,\" said Eugenia Ermacora of the Surfrider Foundation. \"It's a concern, and everybody is asking, When can we go back? When is it safe? And I wish I had an answer.\" Chad White, a surfer who grew up in the Palisades and who protested against the EPA sorting site along the Pacific Coast Highway, said there's no way he would surf there now - it would be too painful to look at the coast and be reminded of what has been lost. And there's too much metal and other debris in the surf. \"It's taken my desire to surf down to zero, not just because of the water quality, but just because of what's happening,\" he said over coffee in Topanga Canyon. He rode his first wave in 1977 at Will Rogers State Beach and taught his son to surf at age four and his wife at age 60. \"It's earth-shattering to someone like me,\" he said of the destruction along the coast. \"That beach means something to me too, and I'm one person. There are tens of, maybe hundreds or thousands of us that utilize the beach every day.\" Many of Mr White's friends lost their homes and he said people are traumatised to see what the landscape and coast around them looks like now. \"Every movie that you see, every film that makes anybody from any other part of the world want to come to California is based on their seeing that Pacific Coast Highway and those beautiful homes in Malibu, across along the beach. They're all gone,\" he said. \"Now it's a toxic waste dump.\" Donald Trump says the deal would give Ukraine \"the right to fight on\" in its war with Russia. The statue commemorates Colonel Robert A Smith, a Scot who was struck down in Kentucky during the US civil war. \"They'll be extended an invitation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"They deserve to be down here.\" The petition accuses Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty, but has no legal force.

        "summary": "It is hoped the festival will now change the way other outdoor events are staged.",
        "content": "Massive Attack's first homecoming gig in five years has broken a world record for producing the lowest ever carbon emissions, a new report states. Scientists from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research said in its report that the Bristol festival cut emissions by being 100% battery powered and selling 100% vegan food. It is hoped the event will now be used as template by other organisers to transform how outdoor festivals are hosted. Massive Attack's Robert Del Naja - AKA 3D - said he is \"grateful to the team and the fans that produced the world-leading event\". The report was made by comparing emissions from Massive Attack's show - known as the Act 1.5 - with the emissions from a standard hypothetical outdoor live music event. Act 1.5 produced 98% less power emissions than comparable shows, the report found. Vegan food and a fleet of electric vehicles also helped reduce catering emissions by 89% and haulage emissions by 70%. Mark Donne, ACT 1.5 lead producer, said the show was the \"cleanest, greenest festival event ever staged\". \"Clean technology is ready – it just needs to be facilitated; fans want clean shows, that's very clear. The challenge for promoters and government now is to meet that need,\" he added. Professor Carly McLachlan, associate director at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, said this \"proof-of-concept show could change the landscape for outdoor festivals\". \"It demonstrated that there are real opportunities for promoters, providers, local authorities and central government to create the conditions for the UK to lead the world in super-low carbon events,\" she added. While significant emissions have been saved, the report highlighted that the 5% of the audience that flew to the show generated 64% of the event's overall greenhouse gases. With more big artists favouring large world tours in a shorter list of locations - this represents a headache for the industry if it wants to contribute to meeting climate targets, the reports states. \"There's a huge question now for tour planning, but also for media and promotor marketing campaigns high on the glitz of epic summer tours that normalise leisure aviation,\"  Del Naja added.

        "headline": "The former fracking site now tapped for clean geothermal heat",
        "author": "Chris Baraniuk",
        "published_date": "6 days ago",
        "summary": "Several old fossil fuel wells in the north of England were going to be used for fracking. Instead, they may now be a template for the UK's geothermal industry.",
        "content": "Several old fossil fuel wells in the north of England – including one that runs 3km deep – were going to be used for fracking. Instead, they may be a template for the UK's geothermal industry. As the police moved in, Mike Potter gritted his teeth. It seemed to him that he and his fellow protesters were being \"kettled\" – surrounded by police and constrained from moving. \"No fracking here!\", the demonstrators chanted, gripping their colourful placards. Fracking, the process of injecting fluid deep into subterranean rock to force out natural gas, emerged during the US Civil War in the 1860s and was first used commercially in the late 1940s. By the 1970s, it had arrived in the UK; over the next 30 years, around 200 gas wells were fracked across the country. But, aside from the question of contributing to further carbon emissions, fracking is potentially dangerous, as it can sometimes trigger earthquakes or contaminate groundwater. In 2016, the prospect of it came to the tiny village of Kirby Misperton in the north of England, close to Potter's home. That year, a local council granted the energy firm Third Energy planning permission to begin fracking at the site. \"I thought, until all these people, governments and companies, can actually prove to me that they can and will do this safely,\" recalls Potter, \"I'm going to be anti-fracking.\" It was a risk. He had a government job with security clearance – if police arrested him, it could have been highly damaging to his career. In the end, widespread opposition to fracking led to the UK government banning the practice in England in 2019. Potter and his fellow protestors were relieved. But questions remained – namely, what was going to happen to the would-be fracking site, a roughly rectangular patch of ground packed with industrial equipment and surrounded by North Yorkshire fields? For years, deep boreholes had yielded gas here, but that gas is now depleted. (And this explains Third Energy’s previous attempts to repurpose the wells for fracking, to squeeze some more gas out of the site.) Now, the firm, acquired in 2024 by renewables company CeraPhi Energy, says it has a new and very different idea: geothermal energy. Around the world, many different forms of geothermal energy are in use. Iceland, for instance, gains a significant portion of its heating needs from geothermal. Its engineers have long worked on a project to tap into the searing heat of an underground volcano to generate electricity. But geothermal potential also lies in less geologically active places. And old oil wells, sometimes multiple kilometres deep, can reach underground regions that are naturally warm. The deeper you go, the hotter the rocks tend to be. In the approach proposed by Third Energy, known as closed-loop geothermal, a sealed, water-filled loop is sunk deep inside former oil or gas wells to absorb the naturally occurring heat at their bases. The warmed water in the loop then returns to the surface. In this way, the heat can be passed to nearby buildings. Unlike fracking, there is no forcing of fluid into the adjacent rock. \"You're not touching the geology at all,\" says Russell Hoare, managing director at Third Energy. \"You're just putting a small tube on the inside of the well.\" The deepest well at Kirby Misperton, dubbed KM8, descends for 3km (1.9 miles). In tests, the temperature at the well's base was even hotter than Third Energy expected – around 115C (240F), rather than the anticipated 90C (190F) or so. Early experiments by Third Energy suggested that the system could maintain a steady temperature of around 42C (108F) at the surface. Heat pumps would boost this heat supply further, if necessary, before passing it on to local homes. \"That well, if it was configured properly, could probably provide enough heat for 100 homes,\" says Hoare. Hoare also says that Third Energy has a total of 12 wells it could use for geothermal energy in Yorkshire, three of them at Kirby Misperton. \"What this gives me is potentially another 25-plus years' life out of those wells,\" he adds, explaining that the firm is keen to drill additional wells locally to expand their future network of geothermal boreholes, if possible. The process isn't cheap. Even for a well half the depth of KM8, it could cost up to £1m ($1.3m) to drill and fit it with the water loop equipment. But there's a big potential pay-off, says Hoare: the wells might provide heat for many years, practically without interruption, so long as the resource is maintained by occasionally topping up the underground heat. This could be achieved by periodically sending hot water down the loop within the well to raise the temperature of the geology below. Former protestors like Potter scrutinised Third Energy's proposals. Many were initially sceptical of the plans. But after witnessing a demonstration of how the system might work, Potter says, \"I was absolutely blown away.\" He now volunteers on behalf of Third Energy and has canvassed local organisations and businesses, from schools to a nearby swimming pool, to find out how much heat energy they need and whether they might be able to make use of a future geothermal supply. Fellow former protestor and local resident Hazel Winter, a teaching assistant, is also gung-ho for the new idea. \"It's all for the good, it's a complete turnaround,\" adds Winter. \"It helps them keep fossil fuels in the ground and it could be the template for a whole new industry.\" Potter recalls marvelling at the system – heat drawn out of the ground and yet no disruption to the rock or soil below. \"I was looking at this thinking, 'This is just too good to be true – what's the catch?'\" he says. However, there may be one, according to Gioia Falcone, an expert in geothermal energy at the UK's University of Glasgow. In particular, she is highly sceptical of Third Energy's claim that KM8 alone could potentially provide enough heat for 100 British homes. \"I doubt very much that even if all 12 boreholes were fitted with this concept that they could be heating 100 homes,\" she says. In a conference paper delivered in February 2025, Falcone and colleagues presented an analysis of the KM8 well's potential. They found that KM8 might not stay as hot as hoped. As heat is drawn out of the well, the temperature in the surrounding geology will drop over time, they say. The team calculates that the output temperature may ultimately be limited to 21.8C (71.2F), which would result in only enough heat energy to supply a maximum of 19 homes, if each home uses around 11,200 KWh annually. Hoare says the paper is \"flawed\" because Falcone and her colleagues did not have full access to all the data the company has collected about the functioning of the well system – such as the steady state temperature the well has achieved, which is higher than the one calculated by the researchers. He also says that the system would perform best with multiple heat pumps at each residential user's property, which the paper does not appear to consider. As a result, he says, the three wells could supply much more energy than the paper's estimate – 6,900,000 kWh over 12 months, or enough for a few hundred homes each requiring 10,000 kWh, allowing for some losses in the distribution of that heat. Fleur Loveridge at the University of Leeds in the UK, who specialises in underground energy systems, says there are examples of closed-loop borehole heat exchangers that have produced significant amounts of heat. There is one in Germany, for instance, which researchers say has a capacity of 600 kilowatts. This is from a single, roughly 3km-deep borehole, not unlike KM8. That might provide many thousands, or potentially more than a million, kWh of heat energy over a whole year, depending on how the system was managed – which could be enough to heat 100 homes, just as Hoare suggested. \"It certainly sounds ambitious but it doesn't sound impossible,\" says Loveridge, who praises Third Energy's proposals for Kirby Misperton. \"And it's exactly the sort of thing we should be doing.\" Roughly a quarter of carbon emissions in the UK comes from the heating of buildings, Loveridge says, and it is particularly difficult to move away from heat sources such as natural gas. The vast majority of domestic heating systems in the UK currently use gas or oil and switching to alternatives can sometimes be costly or impractical for homeowners. Renewables such as geothermal ought to play a \"substantive\" role in the future, she says. There are signs that geothermal energy is beginning to gain ground. The British Geological Survey began work on a project in 2024 that will see 28 relatively shallow boreholes, 225m (740ft) deep, drilled near their headquarters in Nottinghamshire – an effort to decarbonise the heating of the organisation's offices. Elsewhere, the US Geothermal Technologies Office has run an initiative to explore converting old oil wells to geothermal energy sites in states including Utah, Texas and Nevada. The European Union has also funded research in a similar vein. While Third Energy is focused on deep boreholes, shallow boreholes, less than 500m (1,640ft) in depth, can be useful, too, says Falcone. This is because they can store thermal energy in the summer so that it will be available in the winter when heat is needed. This kind of system could supply a university campus or an urban district, she says. As for Kirby Misperton, the heavy work required to make Third Energy's proposals a reality has not yet begun. Hoare says the firm received a grant for £40,000 ($50,400) in February, which will help it move further towards launching a large-scale project beyond a mere demonstration. In the meantime, Potter fizzes with enthusiasm at the potential. \"This is our home-produced heat energy,\" he says, mindful of the high price British homeowners have paid for imported gas and other heating fuels in recent years. If a geothermal project at Kirby Misperton never gets off the ground, or never lives up to the promises made by Third Energy, Potter says he will be \"most disappointed\". But if it does work and if the technology could be replicated across the rest of the UK, he adds, \"It could be absolutely massive.\" *Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Kirby Misperton wells had yielded oil. This has been corrected to clarify that they were gas only wells. -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

A wildflower meadow, ponds, scrub habitat, coastline and even an area of peat bog can be found on this little 60-acre (24-hectare) plot, which boasts roe deer, otters, lizards, eels and a huge array of insects and birds. \"We do describe it as a microcosm of Scotland,\" says Beaton. \"If you think of all of the major habitats of Scotland, we've got them here on the Plock, just in miniature.\" It's an impression she works to cultivate. \"The more little pockets we have, the more chance a person has to... end up having a nature experience,\" she says. All of these habitats had fallen into serious disarray until a few years ago, says Beaton. In fact, most of this area used to be a golf course. The Plock is part of a small but significant global trend of land once used for golf being turned back over to nature. From California to Pennsylvania and Australia to Canada, these projects are reaping in some big rewards for both biodiversity and local people. But what does it take to rewild a golf course? Could this be a key to both supporting biodiversity and helping more people get the immense benefits that come with interacting with nature? And what do we win – and lose – in the process? Huge swathes of land are used for golf. According to one recent study, many countries across the world, including the UK and the US, use far more land for golf courses than they do for wind or solar energy. The US has the most courses of any country by far: its 16,300 golf courses occupy an estimated 8,000 sq km (2 million acres), an area around a third of the size of Vermont. Golf emerged as a sport in my home country of Scotland in the 15th-17th Centuries, and for a time was relatively widely played, with courses often shared spaces used for walking and other activities as well as golf. Over the last century or so, however, it has widely emerged as the sport of the most affluent in society. Luxury hotels and golf clubs have sprung up across the world, sometimes damaging precious ecosystems in the process. In just one example, in 2017 a golf course built by now US president Donald Trump in Aberdeenshire was found by a Scottish government watchdog to have \"destroyed” the sand dune system it was built on, causing permanent habitat loss and loss of its status as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). Responding to a request for comment about these criticisms, Sarah Malone, executive vice president of Trump International, Scotland, called the reports \"inaccurate and grossly misleading\". \"Nature Scot [Scotland's conservation body] ignored and neglected the dunes under the previous ownership and have barely set foot on this site over the past 20 years,\" she said. \"Their own assessment acknowledged that many attributes of the SSSI – which was, in fact, less than 3% of our vast estate – had flourished since the first golf course was completed in 2012. Trump International's ongoing investment and care of the land is beyond question, as anyone who actually visits the property will attest.\" A separate proposal for an 18-hole golf course on another fragile Scottish dune sand ecosystem continues to divide public opinion. There are other environmental impacts of golf courses alongside land use. In the US, an estimated 1.5 billion gallons (5.7 billion litres) of water a day is used to irrigate golf courses, mostly from lakes and onsite wells. Courses are also treated with some 100,000 tonnes of nitrogen, phosphorus and potash a year. Run off from these fertilisers and pesticides have been found to cause risks to humans, wildlife and the environment. \"Certainly, some of the key environmental concerns with golf over time have involved pesticide spraying, the quantity of water used, especially in times of drought, and the significant amount of land sometimes needed for a golf course,\" says Brad Millington, associate professor of sport management at Brock University in Ontario, Canada, and co-author of The greening of golf. The environmental impact of golf has also developed over time, Millington adds, as humans have developed the capacity to build golf courses \"seemingly just about anywhere\", no matter the type of land. Golf has increasingly become a target for environmental activists. Brazilian activists camped out on a highway in Rio de Janeiro ahead of the 2016 Olympics, to protest the city's decision to build a new course on an area of environmental protection. In 2022, climate activists in France filled golf course holes with cement to protest an exemption from water bans amidst a severe drought. In 2024, Extinction Rebellion activists disrupted the Travellers Championship, a golf competition in Connecticut, spraying coloured smoke and powder and sporting t-shirts reading, \"No golf on a dead planet\". Some anti-golf movements completely reject golf, a view that's become common to see on social media in recent years. But the overall impact of any individual golf course depends on a huge array of factors, says Millington: the amount of non-recycled water and pesticides used in maintenance, for example, and what was there before the golf course was built in the first place. From an environmental standpoint, it's also worth considering what else the land might be used for. Land disused for golf can end up being developed for housing or commercial ventures. And while building housing is important for many other reasons, concreting over part of the land may well not improve the environmental profile of an ex-golf course, leading some to argue brownfield sites should be used instead. During the decades that the Plock was a golf course, meanwhile, some of its natural habitats remained. Most of the woodland here is natural, and the peat bog, while deliberately drained by golfers, also survived, based on the depth of peat, which accumulates very slowly, Beaton estimates it could be over 1,000 years old. Previously used for farming, the Plock was never a high-end golf course: it first opened for the community in the 1920s by the local lord and lady, says Beaton, and after various ups and downs the course eventually petered out in the mid 2000s. For a time the land was left largely to its own devices. In 2019, the trust which owned the land passed it to the local Kyle of Lochalsh Community Trust, which opted for it to become parkland. \"It was just overgrown and abandoned and just unloved, really severely unloved,\" says Beaton. \"A lot of effort has gone into bringing it back.\" The main green, previously kept short and highly manicured for golf, had become a dense area of tussocky grass. Now it is managed as a permanent wildflower meadow with over 80 species of flowering plant, from native orchids to pignuts and goldenrods, and heaves with butterflies and other insects. \"In the height of summer, it is just beautiful. It's absolutely beautiful,\" says Beaton. Many of the golf tees, meanwhile, have been reclaimed by scrub and will, in time, naturally become woodland, says Beaton. Fresh water is being brought back, supporting its new otter population. The peatland is being rewetted, a measure which can stunt carbon emissions and bring back species. Beaton, who is in her mid-30s, clearly has an unbridled affection for the Plock. She grew up on a farm in the Scottish borders and previously worked as a warden on Uist in the Outer Hebrides, before moving to Kyle of Lochalsh in 2021 to start work as one of the Plock's two rangers. \"We just work away to make it as good a place as possible for all the visitors and users, whether human or wildlife,\" she says. The struggle, as always, is money. The transformation of the Plock has largely been supported by grants. The trust has explored other options: charging for scything training, a secondhand shop and community facilities, including a laundrette it runs in the village. But it will need something larger scale to become self-sustaining, says Beaton: likely some kind of onsite tourist accommodation. It also hopes to build a traditional-build longhouse to use as a small museum, ticketed for tourists. \"I think the sustainable income is going to be the big challenge,\" says Beaton. \"How we approach that, how we develop that, that is going to be the big question.\" Magical as it is, the Plock is certainly miniscule. But it's not an isolated example of an ex-golf course being repurposed for nature. Projects are springing up in Scotland, the wider UK as well as across the Atlantic in the US and Canada. In 2018, The Trust for Public Land (TPL), a US non-profit, bought the 157-acre (64-hectare) San Geronimo Golf Course in California and set about creating a new commons and restoring its wildlife and streams. At the time, the golf course was likely one of the top 10 water users in Marin County, says Erica Williams, who led the TPL's work on the park. San Geronimo Golf Course was a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a climate-resilient ecosystem\", says Williams, by reconnecting the property's creeks and waterways as well as recreating its historic floodplain. The trust opened pathways to the public and stopped irrigating the land. It worked with partners to restore the ecosystem of the endangered coho salmon. \"The 2024 spawning season brought record numbers of spawning salmon to the San Geronimo Valley watershed, particularly to Larsen Creek,\" says Williams. Hundreds of species have been spotted in the park: everything from deer, coyote and bobcats to native egrets, ducks and hawks, along with dozens of native plant species. While some people did experience the loss of the golf course, many residents and users have expressed \"their deep gratitude for this beautiful now publicly accessible landscape\", says Williams. \"Overall, the public reaction has been quite positive,\" she says. In August 2024, the TPL transferred ownership of the San Geronimo Golf Couse, now known as the San Geronimo Commons, to the local government, including land set aside for a future fire station. The TPL has used a similar model of restoration and transfer to public ownership with several other golf courses, usually ones that were becoming financially unviable, says Williams. In fact, snapping up golf course land for rewilding in the US makes a lot of sense, because the land covered by golf courses has been decreasing for decades, falling by 12% between 2005 and 2021. \"Given the climate crisis, there's a good case to use [this land] to address problems such as biodiversity loss,\" says Millington. More like this: • The decoy ploy to save Scotland's elusive capercaillie • How bug poo can help reverse the soil crisis • Seven big climate and nature moments coming in 2025 Golf course properties are often large, adds Williams, and by design often built within larger natural landscapes near natural features, such as creeks and streams. \"They are often relatively flat, with cart paths and trails that allow for public access.\" Long broad golf course airways can present a unique opportunity for wildlife corridors, she adds. Plus, they tend to consume a lot of water, meaning rewilding can help with significant water conservation. Of course, closure is not the only way to bring nature back into golf courses. In some cases, the TPL has saved golf courses that were otherwise set for closure, and worked to open up the game to everyone while also managing the land in a way that works for wildlife. On many actively used golf courses around the world, greenskeepers are making efforts to manage the land to better support nature, which is often cheaper too. In fact, in the US fertiliser and water use in golf have substantially decreased in recent decades – in part due to course closures, but largely due to management changes. Naturalised areas, sections of the golf course that aren't so heavily maintained, have also been on the rise. In 2015 survey, 46% of US golf courses said they had increased the land dedicated to naturalised areas over the past decade, with just 5% saying they had decreased it. \"This can be done to reduce maintenance costs but there can be an environmental angle as well, such as enabling wildlife to flourish,\" says Millington. However, while many golfers support wilding efforts on non-play areas, there can be trade offs in terms of playability of having more dense vegetation around. Golf courses that are being made a little wilder can offer lessons for other types of land as well. \"I do think there's ways of introducing nature into manicured landscapes,” says Beaton. \"You can do it in cities, you can do it in any sort of any land.\" Because ultimately, what managers of many rewilded golf courses tend to emphasise is the benefit to local people. At San Geronimo, people from across the San Francisco Bay Area come to hike, bike, walk their dogs and ride horses, says Williams. \"One thing that is absolutely wonderful to see is the multigenerational use, made possible by the property's gentle terrain. I've seen family members, young and old, walking together on the land.\" Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 3.8kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. At the Plock, nestled helpfully close to the town of Kyle of Lochalsh, paths now wind through the tightly knit ecosystems, many of them disabled-friendly. The Plock runs guided walks, a mental health support group and scything classes (useful for locals with big gardens or crofts who want to cut away overgrown bracken). It also hosts groups of local schoolchildren, who sometimes help with restoration efforts. \"If you can imagine little nursery kids, so you're talking three, four year olds coming along and planting a wee tree with a spade,\" Beaton says of one recent visit. \"And then I had to come back afterwards and just make sure they were properly in the ground. But you know, they did that. When they're 20, this is going to be a woodland.\" Leaving the Plock after my walk with Beaton, I meet William Roe, a local who comes here to walk his two Hungarian vizsla dogs almost every day. I ask him whether it’s a shame to have lost the golf course, but he shakes his head. \"You can make a golf course in lots of places… but you can't make something like this.\" There are oak trees here, he adds, that are more than 200 years old. \"And that just tells you that this place has been special for a long time, and I hope it will be forever more,\" he says.

        "headline": "The little bug with a big appetite turning organic waste into sustainable fertiliser",
        "author": "Miranda Lipton",
        "published_date": "4 February 2025",
        "summary": "These tiny soldiers can eat four times their own weight in organic waste – and turn it into sustainable fertiliser.",
        "content": "These tiny soldiers can eat four times their own weight in organic waste – and turn it into sustainable fertiliser. With a unique ability to consume nearly any form of organic matter it comes across, one small but mighty insect is becoming a tool to address the growing problem of organic waste and soil degradation. The bug, black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), transforms food waste into nutrient-rich biofertiliser: frass. Insects have been long been used in agricultural practices as a food source – but now farmers are exploring the potential of bug poo as a sustainable fertiliser. With over 33% of the world's soil currently degraded, depleted of the nutrients necessary for healthy plant growth, frass can play a major role in restoring soil biodiversity and quality. In May 2024, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) awarded grants to three projects that seek to harness this soldier fly's capabilities. This included Chapul Farms, an Oregon-based project development company that's reweaving insects back into American agriculture to eliminate food waste, restore soil health, and produce high-quality animal feed. Backed by the Fertilizer Production and Expansion Program (FPEP), the bipartisan support of the use of insects in agriculture highlights the growing recognition of BSFL's potential – for both waste reduction and for enhancing soil health through the production of high quality domestic fertiliser. But despite the bug's seeming superpowers, the widespread application of BSFL remains limited. The question is: why? And how can companies like Chapul Farms, now equipped with federal support, change that? BSFL can consume nearly any kind of organic waste, from food scraps to agricultural byproducts. Facilities like Chapul Farms utilise its voracious appetite to process large quantities of waste, with the larvae consuming up to four times their own body waste in organic matter everyday. This happens in a fraction of the time required for traditional composting, which can take up to 10 months. The larvae's efficiency allows for a rapid turnover of organic material into nutrient-rich excrement – or frass. \"They can reproduce pretty quickly too,\" says Shankar Ganapathi Shanmugam, Assistant Research Professor in the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences at Mississippi State University. \"And it [BSFL] grows on dead and decaying material, which means that it can survive on waste.\" Shanmugam is spearheading research on the use of frass as a crop nutrient, which until now has not been studied in the US – though it has been studied in other parts of the world, notably in multiple countries across Europe. Chapul collaborates with neighbouring farms to exchange waste for frass, creating a circular system. It's a mutually beneficial exchange as the farms receive nutrient-rich soil amendment and Chapul receives the fuel for their operation. And it's doing something significant for insect populations too: helping to repopulate them. This is because insect farming operations create a controlled environment for the bugs to thrive. The frass created from them provides essential nutrients to plants and fosters a more biodiverse soil, which encourages the growth of native plant and insect species, thus supporting the overall ecosystem. Carbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here. \"We could make compost out of anything but the impact of running it through this insect biology has all of these [positive] implications,\" says Mimi Casteel, an Oregon wine farmer who has been using Chapul's frass. \"It's exciting for so many reasons: it's a portable, pretty low cost investment compared to some other things that we're considering as part of dealing with our massive problems with waste, and soldier flies are replacing a missing layer of diversity.\" Chapul has worked with local vineyards, researchers and farms to research, educate and promote frass benefits and adoption in the bioregion. TAINABLE, a local soil restoration non-profit, provides laboratory space and farmland to Chapul for their research. As organic waste production continues to place a massive burden on energy and carbon emissions, there is an increasing need for more efficient and sustainable processing methods. And BSFL's digestive processes can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \"Finding a use for this is important, but if you're going to market frass as a fertiliser, you need to regulate it, which takes time,\" says Shanmugam. \"And to make these regulations you need research.\" The US National Organic Program does not include insects as an acceptable additive as of now. This makes it a challenge to share this technique with farmers who use organic practices, though teams like Chapul Farms are in conversations with regulators to increase education around it and usher in its inclusion. Unlike chemical fertilisers, which often deplete soil over time, frass promotes biodiversity within the soil by introducing a diverse microbial community. This boosts soil resilience, natural plant defence, improves its ability to retain water, and reduces the need for costly synthetic inputs. In sharp contrast, synthetics can wreck soil biodiversity, beneficial bacteria and the soil's natural micro-ecosystem, leaving it dependent on increasingly expensive inputs. They also have intensive fossil-fuel requirements, and reduce soil's carbon carrying capacity. \"We recently saw even more of a push for our government to get projects funded that support domestic fertiliser production,\" says Aly Moore, Chief Communications Officer of Chapul Farms. \"We realise how many health issues are caused by the reduced nutrient density in crops, and all the pesticides used. And on the cost factor, farmers will not only need less fertiliser over time, but also fewer pesticides.\" This can all contribute to cost savings and be more incentive for farmers, especially at a time when fertiliser prices are sky high and supply is unreliable. Prices more than doubled between 2021 and 2022. With the US being the world's third-largest fertiliser importer, American farmers felt the brunt of this impact; making it not just a fertiliser issue, but also one of food security. \"In the two years leading up to 2023, there was an 8% reduction in global fertiliser consumption, because people were priced out of the market,\" says Michael Place, Chief Technology Officer at Chapul Farms. \"There were supply disruptions and even unavailability. And FPEP emerged from this sort of emergency.\" Soil microbes present an exciting frontier for regenerating soil health, yet less than 1% of total microbes in soil have been cultivated. Frass provides an opportunity to pivot from the reductionist methods of treating soils that perpetuated the soil crisis in the first place, all while bolstering food and agricultural security. Farmers will eventually need less frass to maintain the same levels of soil productivity, as the microbes in frass proliferate over time, rebuilding soil health and resiliency by improving biodiversity. More like this: • The foods that eat up carbon • A 2,000-year-old method to water crops • The ignored potential of human poo Farmers who have begun using frass in their fields are already reporting promising results. Casteel is in the midst of facilitating trials to assess the impact of frass on her crops. While the statistical outcome of the study is still in progress, she has already witnessed perceptible changes. \"Anecdotally, what I can tell you is that in the trials that I've done both with grapevines and in my vegetable farm, the produce itself comes up faster, it has better cellular structure,\" says Casteel. \"So if you actually cut the leaf and put it under the microscope, the cells grow more densely and they have figure lipid membranes. And what that means is that the plant from day one has more structural integrity,\" she says. The FPEP funds will support construction and equipment for BSFL facilities located in Oregon and North Dakota. The projects anticipate yielding 10,000 tons of frass per location per year and will generate 59 new jobs, upon its opening which is expected to be in 2026. One of the greatest challenges facing the nascent insect agriculture industry is the tunnel vision around insects for protein production which has overshadowed the benefits of frass in soil health. While protein from BSFL is a lucrative and fast-growing market, frass remains an underutilised resource in insect agriculture. The global insect protein market was valued at nearly $1 billion in 2022 (£805m), while global frass was valued at $96 million (£77m) in 2023, and frass's projected growth is substantially higher. Plus, according to the Chapul Farms team, insect farms produce twice as much frass as larvae. \"I think farmers have historically been convinced that insects are problems, and they just don't want to talk about adding more problems to their situation,\" says Casteel. \"But when our farms become more complex, you start to see an exponential rollout of ecological returns.\" In addition, insects are keystone species, meaning entire ecosystems would drastically change or collapse without them – and our world would \"grind to a halt\", as the biologist Dave Goulson wrote in the Guardian newspaper. \"Ultimately, at its core, we cannot survive without insects,\" says Pat Crowley, CEO of Chapul Farms. \"Natural ecosystems cannot flourish... without the insects as a part of them. And that's one of our biggest premises. It's not as simple as: insects will solve the biggest trends in global agricultural health. And at the same time, I think it's one of the biggest levers that we have in making agriculture a more resilient, ecosystem-based model.\" -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

        "headline": "Which is worse for wildlife, wind farms or oil drilling?",

        "content": "US President Donald Trump says that wind farms harm birds and whales. Scientists weigh wind power's impacts on wildlife against those of oil and gas. Aspen Ellis, a seabird biologist at University of California, Santa Cruz, spent a decade doing field work on remote islands off the coast of the United States. She often lived for months amongst thousands of birds, becoming so immersed in their ways that she even learned to tell which predators were nearby from the birds' calls. But as she added her observations to 40 or 50 years of previous research on these colonies, she noticed a worrying pattern. \"Again and again, I just found myself logging the impact of climate change over time,\" she recalls, from rising sea levels that threatened breeding colonies, to fish moving to cooler areas and leaving seabird chicks starving. \"Without addressing this larger issue of climate change, the seabird conversation work we were doing wasn't sufficient to save those populations,\" she adds. She decided to change focus – and today, studies ways to make clean-energy offshore wind farms safer for birds. The impact of energy production on wildlife has come into the spotlight again amid US President Donald Trump's plan to pivot the country's supply from renewables such as wind, to oil and gas. In his first days in office, Trump revoked former-president Joe Biden's ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling. \"We will drill, baby, drill,\" Trump promised when he was inaugurated, while putting the brakes on the expansion of wind farms. One of his arguments is that wind farms harm birds and whales. His executive order halting offshore wind farm development cited the importance of marine life as one of the reasons for the decision. Renewables beyond the US The US energy policy pivot towards fossil fuels is halting wind power developments for now, even as other nations press ahead with the expansion. China, for example, is home to almost two-thirds of the world's solar and wind power projects in construction. After China, the UK is the world's next-largest offshore wind market. Scotland's government has described wind power expansion as a \"once in a generation economic opportunity\", with a pipeline of around 40GW of offshore wind capacity in addition to 3GW already in Scottish waters. Meanwhile, the fastest-growing renewables sector of any major economy belongs to India. And in almost every country worldwide, wind and solar remain the cheapest way to add new power. While wind farms can have some adverse effects on local wildlife in the habitats where they are sited, including through noise, Ellis and other scientists specialising in the environmental impact of wind farms challenge the claim that wind power is more damaging to wildlife than fossil fuel extraction. They describe wind energy as a powerful and necessary weapon against climate change, arguing that its impact on wildlife can be understood, managed and reduced. They contrast this with the existential risk posed by fossil fuels driving global warming – along with the ongoing noise and pollution from oil and gas production. The debate is highlighting one of the most challenging conundrums facing renewable energy projects around the world – to what degree must they balance the impact they can have on local environments with the global effects of climate change? And how do those wind-power related impacts compare with the local effects of oil and gas drilling? \"Fossil fuels, and their effect on climate change, outweigh everything,\" says Beth Scott, a professor in marine ecology at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, a nation that has become a wind energy powerhouse. \"Climate change is by far, by far the worst enemy, to all wildlife, and humans.\" Speaking from Aberdeen, she points to her window, at a brewing storm due to batter Scotland later in the day. It's too soon to say if this particular storm has been made stronger by climate change, but the overall picture is clear – extreme weather is \"only going to get worse\" in a warmer world, she says. Scott and her colleagues are studying the impact of wind power on the marine ecosystem. While that impact exists – more on it later – she also describes wind power especially useful tool in the switch to renewable, climate-friendly energy because it can be built quickly and at scale. \"Once you start construction, in less than two years, you can build a 2GW [offshore wind] farm – the equivalent of a nuclear plant,\" Scott says. Nuclear power plants can take over a decade to construct. \"So, in terms of rapid response to climate change, there's that.\" Ellis also sees wind power as especially promising. \"There is a lot of consensus [among seabird experts] on the need to move from traditional energy sources to a renewable energy framework, and offshore wind has a really big potential to do that,\" she says. \"We're seeing the industry really boom very quickly, there's a lot of interest in that internationally, there's a lot of capacity for it internationally.\" Wind farms, both on land and in the sea, do pose a risk to birds, however, including habitat loss and collisions with the turbine or their blades. In Scotland, for example, the northern gannet and the black-legged kittiwake are considered at high risk of collision with wind farms. Seabirds may also suffer indirect effects, for example if they change their routes to avoid wind farms, and then spend more time and energy finding food. How much seabirds avoid wind farms, and how this affects them, may vary significantly and is still subject to ongoing research. Some, such as the red-throated diver, have been reported to avoid wind farms, while others, such as large gulls, have a mixed response to them, research suggests. Others again, such as cormorants, seek out wind farms to forage and roost there. (Read more about how wind farms can be made safer for birds.) In Scotland, Scott and other scientists are conducting wide-ranging research on the impact of wind farms on the whole food web, including on plankton, using ocean robots and other instruments. Wind power does alter the ecosystem, Scott says, but the impact is not necessarily always negative. Research tracking seals suggests that they now use wind farms as hunting grounds to forage for fish gathering around the turbines, for example, with one seal's tracks showing how the animal made its way through the farm and stopped at different turbines to snack. Decades of research from around the world suggests that oil production affects birds, whales and other wildlife in many different ways. Apart from the climate factor, there is the risk of oil spills as well as smaller, chronic leaks, scientists say, which can harm seabirds, whales, dolphins and other wildlife. Dolphins exposed to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, for example, suffered health problems including chronic lung disease and abnormal hearts, research has shown. Kaitlin Frasier, an associate research scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California, San Diego, and other researchers have studied how the unprecedentedly large and deep offshore oil spill has impacted different whale and dolphin species in the long term. They used acoustic sensors to record the clicks emitted by the animals, and from that, estimated their population density in the area. They found that a decade after the spill, seven of eight monitored species groups had declined, including sperm whales (by up to 31%) and beaked whales (up to 83%). But the sensors also picked up on something else, which you can listen to in the recording below: deafening blasts from oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. \"[The Gulf of Mexico] is a really noisy area because of all of the surveys that are associated with drilling, they do these seismic surveys that generate a whole lot of noise as they are looking for the oil pockets and understanding how the oil is moving,\" says Frasier. The noise from oil and gas is largely from seismic surveys deploying airguns, which are towed behind ships and blast compressed air through the water every 10 seconds, Frasier says. \"They're doing this in deep water, 1,000m (3,280ft) or more, and it's really low frequencies, so theses sound waves travel really far in deep water,\" she says. The sound is so powerful that \"you can hear it all the way across the Gulf of Mexico\". \"So, they're surveying off of Texas, you'll hear it off of Florida, you'll hear it in Mexican waters. There's no way to escape that sound,\" she says. For whales, dolphins and other marine mammals that rely on sound and echolocation to find their food in dark and murky water, such loud and sudden underwater noise can be deeply disorienting, equivalent to being blinded, as well as being very distressing for them, research has shown. \"If you think about a sperm whale, one of the species in our study, a third of the body of the animal is a sound-production device. That's how important sound is to the animal. Their whole life is centred around the use of sound,\" says Frasier. In the Gulf of Mexico, the noise from the airguns as well as vessels may be making it harder for whales and dolphins to forage for food, Frasier suggests. The oil and gas industry, however, maintains that there is no evidence that airgun noise injures or harms marine life, an assertion that environmental groups dispute. \"It's not that we think those sounds are directly killing whales, but those whales use sound in their daily life to find food, to communicate with each other,\" Frasier says. \"Imagine if a light was being blasted into your face every 10 seconds – that would be disruptive as you're trying to go about your day.\" Wind farm construction also involves noise, for example during surveying but also when the pile is hammered into the seabed. Studies have shown that seals and harbour porpoises are affected by the noise from pile-driving, causing them to flee for several miles and affecting their ability to feed. But Frasier highlights that with oil and gas, the surveys happen over a longer time period, not just before but also during extraction. \"We see it in all of our recordings,\" she says of the oil-related noise, which she describes as a constant backdrop to the whale sounds. \"It's very heart-wrenching to listen to.\" By comparison, evidence from European offshore wind farms suggests that loud noise from wind farm construction tends to be more temporary and containable, as it happens during the pile-driving phase. In Europe, some countries such as Germany now legally oblige offshore wind farm developers to place devices called bubble curtains around the construction sites to buffer such pile-driving noise, and protect porpoises and other marine animals. (Read about how bubble curtains work, and their effect on wind farm noise). Once the wind farm is in place, it can keep spinning for decades and then be replaced with new turbines on the same land, whereas oil production moves on once one site is exhausted. There is, however, also ongoing noise in offshore wind farms from the spinning turbines and the supply and maintenance vessels. Ship noise – whether from such maintenance vessels, or shipping generally – can in turn affect marine mammals such as harbour porpoises. Liba Pejchar, a professor and conservation biologist at Colorado State University, and her team have compared the effects of inland wind energy and oil and gas on ecosystems in Colorado and neighbouring Wyoming. These states are home to wind farms, as well as oil and gas fields. One of the aspects they studied was habitat loss and fragmentation, meaning, wildlife habitat being lost or broken up through roads as well as the turbines or oil and gas fields themselves. They found that both onshore wind farms and oil and gas production, caused habitat loss. However, \"we found overall that wind energy resulted in less habitat fragmentation than oil and gas and especially, less impacts over the long term\", she says. \"In the near term, the impacts were often somewhat equivalent, but wind energy is a renewable resource, so once you put in the turbines, they continue to harness that energy for decades to come. Whereas oil and gas have to keep moving, and so those impacts just getting compounded across the landscape.\" While wind power hazards for birds, such as collisions, are well-known, preliminary research by Pejchar's team suggests oil and gas production can also negatively affect birds and their habitat, and for example, have impacted ferruginous hawks in Wyoming. Like the other scientists, Pejchar also highlights how climate change, driven by fossil fuels, is already changing the environment. \"There's a higher frequency of these large, catastrophic fires in Colorado in particular,\" she says. \"Sometimes wildlife can benefit from fire, it's a natural form of disturbance, but the scale of these fires and the intensity and frequency – there could be complete state changes, where forests can no longer be sustained because fire is moving through them on such a regular basis. So that's going to have a huge impact on wildlife communities.\" Both industries are taking steps to reduce the effect their activities have on the local environments where they operate. In a 2022 study co-led by Ellis, an international group of scientists and also conservation organisations such as American Bird Conservancy developed a process that allows wind farm developers to identify and minimise the risks to seabirds. They recommended measures to reduce or offset the impact that included choosing sites that are less in the way of seabirds' known flight routes or habitats; wind farm developers building alternative nesting sites; and developers funding conservation programmes to boost the species in other habitats. \"Seabirds are a great case study for this [process], because we have a lot of data about many of these species,\" Ellis says. In addition, \"seabird conservation is very well understood\", she says, both in terms of specific threats to seabirds, such as predators and invasive plants, and also in terms of how to effectively address those threats, for example by removing predators such as rats, and clearing invasive plants. The assessment process outlined in the study could then also be used to reduce the impact of wind power on other species, such as bats and whales, with measures that are appropriate for them, she says. Regarding the environmental impact of fossil fuel extraction, some of the most important measures have aimed at reducing oil spills and chronic oil pollution, which can be catastrophic for birds and other wildlife. Monitoring of beached, oiled birds in Europe's North Sea has revealed a sharp decline in the rate of oiled birds, suggesting a decrease in oil pollution and spills as a result of measures such as requiring oil tankers to have double hulls. But the attempts to lessen the local effects of energy infrastructure do little to address the wider context of climate change, the threat of which has led to international agreements to phase down fossil fuels. Carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are leading many parts of the world to feel the effects of global warming. And these are beginning to affect the environments where fossil fuels are extracted too. The Gulf of Mexico, for example, has been in the grip of a climate-change-fuelled marine heatwave, which can make hurricanes more intense. Alongside the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels, the intensity of extracting the oil in the Gulf of Mexico has an additional climate impact from the release of large quantities of methane – an even more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide over a 20 year period. Although the global supply of renewable power is surging, and demand for oil, gas and coal are all predicted to peak this decade, the race to build energy infrastructure that doesn't harm wildlife looks set to be a challenge for years to come. How the energy industry responds will be felt in habitats around the world. -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.
